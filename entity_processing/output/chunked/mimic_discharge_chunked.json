After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a representative from hospice. Because of your repeated paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex catheter placement.

The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of consciousness on ___. He was initially seen at ___ where CT imaging of head/neck showed no intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain films didn't show acute abnormality. He was seen by ___ Hematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII assay was 139 and vW level was >200 per report. Per report, his hemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on ___ to 11.6 on ___. Repeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The patient saw his hematologist on ___ and was found to have a hemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease, the patient followed up with his PCP ___ ___ at which time his hemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank hematoma, thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or palpitations, any increase in neck swelling over the course of the week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder ___ resting, ___ moving), though this has improved over the course of the week. In the ED, initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100%/RA. Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6, though repeat was 9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was 103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage along the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary read. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr. ___, was contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin 0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher management. Per review of records, the patient has a history of significant bleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion. Throughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily. He was tested and found to have ___ disease. Later, after wisdom tooth extraction, the patient experienced late (e.g. ___ days later) bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The patient was retested by a hematologist associated with the ___ and was diagnosed with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on multiple occasions, sometimes testing normal, though has been as low as ~50. Upon arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable without complaint.

There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI. #Epistaxis, nasal fractures Patient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. #NSTEMI Patient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This was trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted who thought that this was most likely secondary to demand ischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin. #Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation Patient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious symptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation in left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. -monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered with antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for the Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge. #Acute kidney injury Patient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at PCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The patient was discharged with a stable creatinine. #Peripheral vascular disease Patient had a history of AAA repair in ___ without history of MI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral stents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above.

Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided. Images are substantially degraded due to the patient's body habitus. FINDINGS: CHEST: There are innumerable pulmonary nodules, which have an upper lobe predilection, particularly in the left upper lobe. The largest nodule measures 6 mm in diameter (sequence 3 image 8). Calcification is noted within the right pleural cavity (sequence 3 image 24), which is likely related to the patient's history of previous right lung surgery. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No significant mediastinal, axillary or hilar adenopathy. Cardiac size is normal. No pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: The liver is enlarged and there are innumerable ___ density lesions throughout both lobes of the liver which are replacing the vast majority of the hepatic parenchyma. The portal vein is patent. No intra or extrahepatic duct dilatation. The gallbladder is unremarkable. There is a small amount of ascites adjacent to the right lobe of the liver. The right kidney is mildly compressed anteriorly due to the enlarged liver. There is a subcentimeter ___ density lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney, likely representing a subcentimeter cyst (sequence 5 image 31). The right kidney is otherwise unremarkable. The left kidney is within normal limits. The adrenals and spleen are unremarkable. The pancreas is within normal limits. The small and large bowel are unremarkable. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy. PELVIS: The images of the pelvis are substantially degraded secondary to the patient's body habitus. No pelvic masses are identified. The bladder is unremarkable. The patient is status post supracervical hysterectomy. No pelvic adenopathy. No free fluid within the pelvis. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Bilateral symmetrical sclerosis is identified on the iliac side of the sacroiliac joints, consistent with osteitis condensans ilii. There is severe degenerative change within the right hip joint with joint space loss and osteophyte formation. No destructive osseous lesions. IMPRESSION: Multiple pulmonary and hepatic metastases. No separate primary lesion identified. Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo f with h/o recently diagnosed metastatic cancer of unknown primary presenting with nausea, vomiting, and fever to 101 on day of admission. . # Fever/leukocytosis: Patient presented with fever and leukocytosis, which was initially concerning for post obstructive PNA. Patient was treated with vanc-cefepime-azithro for a day and a half, however CT torso was concerning for ongoing malignancy without evidence of primary tumor. There was no concern for a pneumonia. Consequently, abx were stopped on ___. Patient felt weak and unable to go home, as she lives alone and so was screened by physical therapy and discharged to rehab facility. . # Failure to thrive: Patient presents with 6 weeks of nausea, vomiting and poor PO intake likely from her enlarged liver.

Evaluation at that time included an abdominal CT scan that showed multiple lung and liver metastases. She has yet to undergo definite diagnosis with biopsy, and per recent oncology documentation seems disengaged with care. She was reportedly in her usual state of health until the evening prior to admission, when she developed acute on chronic shortness of breath while at rest. She reported midsternal chest ache associated with this shortness of breath. Pain is exacerbated by direct pressure; nothing seems to alleviate pain. She denied any pleuritic or exertional component to the chest pain or shortness of breath. She feels that symptoms are secondary to her \"cancer\" and \"feels as if the cancer has spread\". She reports stable, chronic nonproductive cough, which has been present over the preceding months. She was seen recently in the ED for evaluation of left greater than right lower extremity edema with lower extremity venous ultrasounds negative, without change in edema since since that visit. She denies associated fever, chills, sweats, PND, orthopnea, or positional component to pain. In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.0 116 100/49 24 99% RA. Labs notable for leukocytosis to 17.9, hematocrit of 32, and lactate of 2.8. Urinalysis was positive, but with 19 epithelial cells.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary, including lesions in the liver and lungs, who initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to worsening intrapulmonary tumor burden, and later underwent percutaneous liver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon cancer, prompting transfer to the oncology service and eventually discharged home with hospice. Active Issues: (1) Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: CTA to exclude pulmonary embolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission demonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic cancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs, which had evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient reluctance to engage with care. Percutaneous liver biopsy ultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Following discussion with her outpatient oncology providers, she was transferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential trial of FLOX. However, given the patient's very poor functional and nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with the patient's HCP, ___ and it was decided to focus goals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient was discharged home with home hospice. (2) Left thigh weakness/spinous tenderness: She was found to have focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse spinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of preserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia. She was noted to be incontinent of urine, but not feces. Given underlying malignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord involvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural abscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin/cefepim ___ to ___. Despite frequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at lumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing claustrophobia. Neuro exam was monitored and remained stable. (3) Abdominal pain: She experienced intermittent abdominal pain and tenderness without peritoneal signs, concerning for obstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy, particularly given episodes of emesis/hematemesis as below. While multiple KUBs were negative for obstruction, CT abdomen was planned to evaluate for alternative sources of intraabdominal pathology, but she declined on multiple occasions. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol as needed. (4) ? Hematemesis: She experienced a single episode of small volume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with blood and found to be guiac positive. Vital signs and hematocrit remained stable. IV pantoprazole was initiated for gastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of PPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was true blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of recurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR. (5) Altered mental status: She was intermittently altered throughout admission, never oriented to more than person and place, with occasional difficulty following simple commands as compared to an uncertain baseline. Infectious work up, including blood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent CXRs, was unrevealing. Noncontrast head CT was negative for acute intracranial process. Brain MRI for definitive exclusion of metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia/MRI aversion as above. ABG on ___ without signs of CO2 retention. History of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible contributing factor and therefore these were discontinued. Hepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic lesions to liver and asterixis on exam. AMS could also be ___ to severe depression. Mental status monitored and remained stable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge. (6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset shortness of breath without frank hypoxia. CTA on admission was negative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could not be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal infiltrate. EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against acute coronary syndrome. Low voltages on EKG were consistent with prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion. Shortness of breath resolved over the course of admission without dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers and expectorants as needed. (7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked at 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting underlying malignancy. As noted above, infectious work up including CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was unrevealing. She remained afebrile, with the exception of isolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs. (8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ to ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin 2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy. Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis or obstructive process. The possibility of superimposed intraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded in the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she declined CT for further evaluation. (9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout admission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting compromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant infiltration. (10) Sinus tachycardia: She remained persistently tachycardic 100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO intake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids. Tachycardia has been present since at least ___. Despite concurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear infectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis. Subsegmental pulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of admission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she was never hypoxic. Hematocrit remained stable without signs of active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as above. (11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and seeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying depression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and treatment of known malignancy. She denied active suicidal ideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly prior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held preprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary. She was seen by social work throughout admission. (12) Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained stable and consistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout admission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the basis of preadmission labs. Vital signs remained stable, with the exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active bleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above. (13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect synthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of malignancy, as well as poor oral intake. There were no signs of active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as above.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Bedbound. Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your admission to ___. As you know, you were admitted for shortness of breath, likely due to your underlying cancer, and there was no evidence of pneumonia or blood clot in the blood vessels of your lungs. Your shortness of breath resolved, but you were found to have weakness in your left thigh and abdominal pain. You declined imaging studies for further investigation of these findings. You underwent biopsy of your liver that revealed that the cancer known to affect your liver and lungs originated in your colon (large bowel). You were transferred to the oncology service, but unfortunately chemotherapy would do more harm for you than good. After a long discussion with you and your health care proxy, it was decided that you will go home to be with your family and loved ones. We will also set up hospice services for you so that they can help with any issues that arise while you are at home. Followup Instructions: ___",

Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased and moderate PA hypertension is now identified. Brief Hospital Course: ___ woman with h/o hypertension, hypelipidemia, diabetes mellitus on insulin, cerebellar-medullary stroke in ___, stage ___ CKD followed by Dr ___ presenting with fatigue and DOE for a few weeks, markedly worse the morning of admission. The patient has known diastolic dysfunction. Of note, she has been noncompliant with her medications at home. On arrival to the floor, she required hydralazine 20 mg to bring down her BP. She has likely had elevated BPs at home for a while, which is contributing to her SOB, CHF exacerbation, and secondary demand myonecrosis (hypertensive urgency) with mildly elevated troponin. # CAD: Although she did not have a classic anginal presentation, patient has several risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. Her only symptom was SOB in the setting of elevated BPs attributed to medication noncompliance at home. Her troponin fell from 0.05 at admission to 0.01 at discharge in the setting of renal dysfunction, but there was not a clear rise and fall to suggest an acute infarction from plaque rupture and thrombosis. She was scheduled for an outpatient stress test to evaluate for evidence of ischemia from flow-limiting CAD. We decreased ASA to 81 mg from 325 mg daily to decrease the risk of bleeding. Her LDL was found to be 146. We wanted to change her from simvastatin to the more potent atorvastatin (and avoid issues with drug-drug interactions), but her insurance would not cover atorvastatin. She was therefore switched to pravastatin 80 mg at discharge. From a cardiac standpoint, we did not feel that Plavix was necessary for CAD, but her neurologist was contacted and wanted Plavix continued. We had to stop metoprolol due to HR in the ___ during admission even off metoprolol. # Pump: Last echo in ___ showed low normal LVEF. Her current presentation was consistent with CHF exacerbation with bilateral pleural effusions, dyspnea, and elevated NT-Pro-BNP. Her TTE showed mild-moderate mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation, LVEF 50-55%, and pulmonary hypertension. We changed her HCTZ to Lasix 40 mg PO at discharge. This medication can be uptitrated as needed. # Hypertension: The patient's nephrologist, Dr. ___, agreed with our proposed medication adjustments, but recommended staying away from clonidine. There has been a H/O medication non-adherence. Social work was involved in discharge planning, and ___ will be assisting the patient at home. We added lisinopril 20 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily and continued nifedipine 120 mg daily. Her atenolol was stopped due to her renal dysfunction, but her metoprolol had to be stopped due to bradycardia. She should continue on once a day medication dosing to help with compliance. # ? COPD: The patient may have a component of COPD as she was wheezing on admission and responded to albuterol. She was given a prescription for albuterol prn. Transitional Issues: - She will be scheduled for outpt stress stress test - She has follow-up appointments with Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ and both can work on uptitrating her BP meds as needed. - ___ will need to work with patient on medication compliance.

The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, regional LV wall motion abnormalities are new. Severity of mitral regurgitation has increased. CARDIAC CATH: ___ 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no obstructive disease. The LAD had a moderate disease in the mid artery and a diagonal branch had an 80% proximal lesion. The Lcx had a 70% proximal lesion. The RCA was totally occluded mid-vessel. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Recommend CABG evaluation CT CHEST: ___ 1. Diffuse confluent ground-glass opacities predominantly in the right upper lobe and right lower lobe most likely represent residual pulmonary edema, localized to the right lung because of direction of jet in mitral regurgitation. 2.

Per pharmacy records, patient had not refilled lasix prescription since ___. Overall, presentation was most consistent with a mild CHF exacerbation. She received treatment with IV lasix and her shortness of breath subsequently improved quickly. She was able to be transitioned to a PO regimen of lasix 40mg qday on ___ (day of discharge). Dry weight on day of discharge was 75.9kg. # Chest Tightness: Patient reported chest tightness associated with her shortness of breath. Was given aspirin and SL nitroglycerin in her PCP's office prior to being directed to the ED. Troponin was negative x2. EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Due to her significant CAD history, she underwent a P-MIBI on ___ which was unremarkable. Her chest tightness was thought to be of non-cardiac etiology. # HTN: Patient presented with SBP of 190-200. Cardiology was consulted and recommended increasing her carvedilol from 6.25mg BID to 12.5mg BID. With this change, and continuation of her other home medications, her blood pressure decreased to systolics in range of 110-146 on day of discharge. It is unclear whether her very elevated BP on admission was occurring in the setting of medication non-compliance. Nifedipine was decreased from BID to daily given increased carvedilol and addition of Lasix (which patient was believed to have been non-compliant with prior to this admission).",

Upon presentation she had a new macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative. She received two units of packed red cells with an appropriate rise in her Hgb to 9.0. Stool was guiac negative, with no reports of dark stool or blood in stool. Her hemoglobin remained stable at this level, there was no overt bleeding, and her stool was guiac negative. After transfusion the patient reported significant improvement in her shortness of breath and fatigue. Given her history of gastritis and diverticulosis, a GI bleed was believed responsible for her anemia. Patient should receive an EGD/colonoscopy as an outpatient. # Acute exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: The patient was also found to be slightly volume overloaded, and was treated with 2x40mg IV Lasix, with good urine output and symptomatic improvement. Her pulmonary edema and peripheral edema resolved with diuresis. CHRONIC ISSUES: # Gastic ulceration: Continued on home pantoprazole BID # Hypertension: Continued on home nifedipine, carvadilol, lisinopril. # Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease: Creatinine remained at baseline (b/l Cr 2.1-2.6) during admission. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ====================== --Patient's Anemia is thought to be due to slow GI bleed given history of gastritis and diverticulosis.
