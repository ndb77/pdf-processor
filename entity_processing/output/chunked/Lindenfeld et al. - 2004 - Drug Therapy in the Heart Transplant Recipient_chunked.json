Table 1 gives trade names, pharmacology, necessary adjustments for renal or hepatic dysfunction, and dosing and general monitoring guidelines for drugs described in this section. Table 2 lists the major adverse effects of immunosuppressive drugs described in Parts I and II of this review and provides an estimate of their relative frequency.",

          "content": "Glucocorticoids are potent immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory agents (the Figure). They diffuse freely across cell membranes and bind to high-affinity cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors. The glucocorticoid receptor–steroid complex translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to a glucocorticoid response element within the DNA.1 The glucocorticoid receptor–steroid complex may also bind to other regulatory elements, inhibiting their binding to DNA. Both actions cause transcriptional regulation, thereby altering the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory response. Glucocorticoids affect the number, distribution, and function of all types of leukocytes (T and B lymphocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, and monocytes), as well as endothelial cells.2 The major effect on lymphocytes appears to be mediated by inhibition of 2 transcription factors, activator protein-1 and nuclear factor (NF) -B.3,4 This affects the expression of a number of genes, including those for growth factors, cytokines, CD40 ligand, GM-CSF, and adhesion and myosin heavy chain molecules.2 In nonlymphoid cells, steroids cause a decrease in the production of vasoactive and chemoattractant factors and lipolytic and proteolytic enzymes. This results in inhibition of neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, prevention of macrophage differentiation, and downregulation of endothelial function, including decreases in myosin heavy chain expression. Some of the antiinflammatory effects of steroids are regulated through the release of lipocortin, which acts by inhibiting phospholipase A2, thus inhibiting the production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins.5,6",

High-dose steroids are generally administered intraoperatively and postoperatively with gradual tapering of doses over months. Pulse steroids, either oral or intravenous, are generally the first treatment for moderate rejection (grade 3A or 3B) without hemodynamic compromise. Approximately 80% to 85% of these rejection episodes respond to the initial corticosteroid regimen.7,8",

Initial human clinical trials in heart transplant recipients suggested that MMF was well tolerated and as efficacious as AZA with less myelosuppression.15 A subsequent large, prospective, multicenter, randomized trial compared AZA and MMF in combination with CSA and steroids. Eleven percent of the patients withdrew before receiving drug because an intravenous form was not available.16 In an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no difference in survival or rejection, but in an analysis of treated patients, there was a reduction in mortality at 1 year (6.2% versus 11.4%; *P*0.031) and a reduction in rejection requiring treatment (65.7% versus 73.7%; *P*0.026) in the MMF patients. The Joint UNOS/ISHLT Thoracic Registry has been analyzed for differences in the effects of MMF and AZA in patients on a CSA-based regimen.17 Patients treated with MMF had an actuarial survival benefit (1 year, 96% versus 93%; 3 year, 91% versus 86%; *P*0.0012). These results are similar to those in renal transplant recipients. MMF is effective in reversing recurrent rejection when used in place of AZA.18,19 In patients with chronic renal dysfunction, switching from AZA to MMF in combination with CSA reduction or withdrawal to improve renal function has also been used as an effective strategy.20 Despite the tolerability and beneficial effects of MMF, it has not replaced AZA entirely, predominantly because of its cost (Table 3). A few transplantation centers still use AZA primarily and reserve MMF for patients with high risk of rejection, recurrent rejection, or intolerance to AZA.",

Immunological mechanisms are shown in blue; immunosuppressive drugs and their site of action are shown in red. Acute rejection begins with recognition of donor antigens that differ from those of recipient by recipient antigen presenting cells (APCs) (indirect allorecognition). Donor APCs (carried passively in graft) may also be recognized by recipient T cells (direct allorecognition). Alloantigens carried by APCs are recognized by TCR-CD3 complex on surface of T cell. When accompanied by costimulatory signals between APC and T cell such as B7-CD28, T-cell activation occurs, resulting in activation of calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates transcription factor NF-AT, allowing it to enter nucleus and bind to promoters of IL-2 and other cytokines. IL-2 activates cell surface receptors (IL-2R), stimulating clonal expansion of T cells (T helper cells). IL-2, along with other cytokines produced by T helper cells, stimulates expansion of other cells of immune system. Activation of IL-2R stimulates TOR, which regulates translation of mRNAs to proteins that regulate cell cycle. Sites of action of individual drugs (highlighted in red) demonstrate multiple sites of action of these drugs, underscoring rationale for combination therapy.

SIR binds to the same family of immunophilins as TAC, the FKBPs, but rather than blocking calcineurindependent T-cell activation, FKBP-SIR inhibits a kinase, the target of rapamycin (TOR) (the Figure). TOR phosphorylates proteins that are important in the regulation of the cell cycle, thus playing a critical role in connecting signals from the growth factor receptors to the cell nucleus for stimulation of growth and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes.40,41 Activation of TOR also signals proliferation of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in response to growth factors.42 This latter mechanism may explain why SIR inhibits arterial smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell proliferation and has been shown to prevent graft atherosclerosis in rat cardiac allografts, to prevent intimal hyperplasia after coronary stenting in native coronary artery disease, and to inhibit tumor growth in animals models.41– 43",

The mean incidence of acute rejection was significantly lower in both SIR groups compared with the placebo and AZA groups.45,46 In 2 other randomized trials in renal transplantation, Groth et al47 demonstrated that SIR was as effective as CSA when combined with AZA and prednisone in preventing acute rejection and graft loss, and Kreis et al48 found equivalent efficacy between SIR and CSA when combined with MMF and prednisone. In these 2 studies, renal function at 1 year was significantly better with SIR than with CSA. SIR has been used effectively in heart transplant recipients in place of CIs to treat rejection or to ameliorate renal dysfunction.49 The precise role of SIR in maintenance immunosuppression has not yet been determined for heart transplant recipients. It is hoped that potential benefits on chronic rejection will not be countered by hyperlipidemia, a common adverse effect of SIR.",
