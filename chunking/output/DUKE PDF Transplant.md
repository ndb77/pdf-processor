# Communicating with Your Heart **Transplant Team**

# Contacting the Heart Transplant Team

The members of the Heart Transplant Team are ready to help you with your heart transplant needs. Our business hours are Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. We are not open on holidays.

### Your Transplant Coordinator can be reached by phone at 919-613-7777 or by sending them a message in My Duke Health.

Please read the suggestions listed below to help you know when and how to contact your heart transplant team.

![](_page_7_Picture_5.jpeg)

# When Should I Call the Transplant Office?

You should call the transplant office when:

- You need an answer to your question(s) within 1 to 2 business days
- You are reporting symptoms or side effects
- You need to explain something in detail, like a symptom or a problem

You will often get our voicemail when you call the transplant office. Please leave your full name, call-back number and reason for your call. This helps us know who to contact to best answer your question.

If you need to report an urgent medical symptom or condition after normal operating hours that cannot wait until the next business day, please call the Duke Operator Line at 919-684-8111 and ask for the transplant coordinator on call. If you are having an emergency, please call 911 or proceed to your local emergency room right away.

![](_page_7_Picture_13.jpeg)

# When Should I Send a My Duke Health Message?

My Duke Health is a way to send a question or message that is not urgent to your health care team. Duke Transplant receives many messages each day. To help us best serve you, please remember:

It may take 3 business days or longer to get a reply. Your providers' first priority is seeing patients in clinic as well as responding to urgent phone messages.

- Office hours apply to My Duke Health messages. Your care team does not check messages after normal business hours.
- My Duke Health messages should be no longer than 3 to 4 sentences. If your message is longer than this, call us so you can better explain the issue.

![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

## When Should I Avoid Sending a My Duke Health Message?

My Duke Health messages should only be used for non-urgent messages. Please do not use it when:

- Communicating urgent or emergent issues
- Communicating symptoms
- " If you have already left a voicemail within the past 48 business hours

![](_page_8_Picture_8.jpeg)

## What Should I Keep in Mind When Communicating with My Team?

In order to help us answer your concerns in the most efficient way possible, please note the following:

- Please do not send multiple messages (voicemail or My Duke Health messages) to your care team about the same topic. This will not result in a faster response.
- Please do not send a message about test results within the first 3 business days after receiving them. Your team will review your results once they are all ready. We will reach out to you before the 3-business-day window if we see results that need urgent changes.
- Please do not send updates on your condition unless specifically requested by the team.

Occasionally, we have to communicate with you by email or our work cell phones, depending on the situation. Please know that these should not be used to communicate with your transplant team. These cannot be checked by covering coordinators in the event that your coordinator is out of the office. Texting is also not an appropriate way to reach out to your coordinator.

![](_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg)

# When Should I Ask For My RN Care Coordinator?

RN Care Coordinators are able to help support you in addition to your transplant coordinator.

Please ask for your RN Care Coordinator if you need the following addressed:

- Medicine refills: These should be requested when you still have at least 7 days of medicines. Do not wait until you are out of medicine to request refills.
- Forms: These include disability, FMLA, and medical clearances.

![](_page_9_Picture_6.jpeg)

# When Should I See Non-Transplant Providers?

You should have a local primary care provider who can further help in making sure your complete health care needs are being met.

We may also ask you to see other specialists. Please be aware that the wait times for these specialists may be longer than you have experienced with the heart transplant team.

# Taking Care of Your New Heart

# The Body's Defense System and Rejection

Your body's defense system  $-$  called the immune system  $-$  works to protect you against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other things your body doesn't recognize as "self." Because your immune system doesn't recognize your new heart as "self," it sees it as being foreign and possibly harmful. So, the same protective response that helps you fight off viral and bacterial illness can also cause harm by attacking your transplanted heart.

To prevent your immune system from damaging your transplanted heart, your immune system must be reduced, or suppressed. Medicines you take after transplant are called immune suppressants or anti-rejection medicines. There are different types of anti-rejection medicines that work on different parts of your body's immune response (see the Transplant Medicines section to read more about this). You will take more than one medicine to suppress your immune system

to prevent and treat rejection. We combine medicines in order to give you the best possible benefits with the least amount of side effects. Although your body's immune response to your new heart may lessen over time, it will never go away. Therefore, you will take some form of anti-rejection medicine for the rest of your life. UNOS (the United Network for Organ Sharing) has more information on preventing rejection. You can find it at transplantliving.org/after-the-transplant/preventing-rejection/.

Please use your smartphone to scan the QR code below for more information on preventing rejection.

# **Common Complications After Heart Transplant**

![](_page_10_Picture_8.jpeg)

### **Organ Rejection**

Rejection occurs when the immune system recognizes the new organ as something foreign in the body and tries to destroy it. Despite taking antirejection medicines, many patients are likely to have at least 1 episode of rejection in the first few months after heart transplant surgery. The vast majority of these episodes occur without symptoms. These are typically diagnosed through our routine biopsies and treated with changes in medications. If you have an episode of acute rejection, your treatment will depend on the level and type of rejection. Your doctors will determine this by doing a biopsy and grading the results on a scale. This will help guide your care plan.

![](_page_11_Picture_0.jpeg)

## Infection

Due to the anti-rejection medicines you will be taking after transplant, your body's ability to fight infection is lowered. This puts you at a greater risk for getting an infection.

Some infections are from viruses you already had that were inactive in your body before surgery and become re-activated with anti-rejection medicines. New infections are also possible.

### Signs of Infection

The earliest signs of infection may be:

- " Fever over 100.4° F or 38° C
- Headache
- Fatigue (feeling very tired)
- Muscle aches

Diarrhea • Loss of appetite

• Vomiting

• Sore throat

- · Nausea
- If you have any signs of an infection, call your transplant coordinator right away.

See the "Infection Risks and Prevention" section of this guide for more information on common types of infections and how to prevent them.

![](_page_11_Picture_15.jpeg)

## **High Blood Pressure**

High blood pressure is common after transplant. Often, blood pressure increases over time due to some of the medicines you take. We will be monitoring your vital signs in clinic. If we have concerns with your blood pressure, we may ask you to monitor your blood pressure at home. Your transplant team will discuss this with you as needed.

![](_page_11_Picture_18.jpeg)

### **Diabetes**

Some of your anti-rejection medicines can cause high blood sugars and can lead to diabetes. We will check your blood sugars with other blood work at your clinic appointments. If you had diabetes before transplant, or were close to developing diabetes, it may be possible that you will need medicines to keep your blood sugar under control. Your transplant team will discuss this with you as needed.

![](_page_12_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### Cancer

Patients who have received a transplant are at higher risk for all types of cancer than they were before the transplant. The most common is skin cancer. It's important that you follow the recommended guidelines for cancer screenings and use preventive measures.

Some of your anti-rejection medicines make you more sensitive to the sun. They also can increase your risk for skin cancer.

To protect your skin, be sure to:

- Use sunscreen with Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of at least 30
- Wear a hat when you are outdoors to protect your head and face
- Wear sun-protective clothing when possible
- See a dermatologist as recommended, monitor your skin, and report any changes to your care team

![](_page_12_Picture_9.jpeg)

## **Kidney Failure**

Many of your medicines are filtered by the kidneys and can cause long-term damage. It is important that you stay hydrated by drinking at least 2 liters of water a day, and follow your medicine regimen to help minimize the risk of kidney damage. This is especially important early after transplant, when higher doses of medicines are necessary. We will monitor your kidney function at each clinic visit.

![](_page_12_Picture_12.jpeg)

## **Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy**

This is a long-term complication (also sometimes called coronary artery vasculopathy) in which coronary arteries of the transplanted heart get smaller in diameter, or "prune," over time. Part of your medicine routine is designed to prevent this from happening. At your 1-year post-transplant appointment, we will send you for a coronary angiogram in the cath lab to see if you show signs of this disease. We will then alternate this test with stress echocardiograms and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the heart each year to continue monitoring. If we find signs of this disease, we'll discuss treatment options with you at that time.

# How Will My Health Be Monitored?

# Heart Biopsies and Follow-Up in Transplant Clinic

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

It's important to have regular follow-up with your heart transplant team so possible problems can be found and treated early.

- We do heart biopsies (examine small samples of heart tissue) to look for evidence of rejection in your new heart. A pathologist will view the tissue samples under a microscope, looking for signs that your immune system is working and for any damage to the heart tissue. Since you may have rejection without symptoms, we do heart biopsies at set time periods when a rejection episode is most likely to occur. We may also do a heart biopsy if you are having any symptoms of rejection. If you have a rejection episode, you may need additional biopsies until the rejection episode is over.
- During years 1 through 3, we may use a blood test to evaluate for rejection. Depending on the results, you may need an additional biopsy.
- You will also have other blood tests at every appointment. This blood work allows us to monitor your kidney function, medicine levels, blood cell counts, and much more.
- Starting at your 1-year anniversary after transplant, you will begin to alternate your yearly visits between:
  - The cath lab, for evaluation of your coronary arteries, and
  - Stress tests and chest CTs
- You will also have chest X-rays and ECGs at regular intervals.

# Typical Clinic Appointment Schedule

| First month after transplant         | Every week for 4 weeks |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Second month after transplant        | Every other week       |
| Months 3 through 6 after transplant  | Every month            |
| Months 8 through 12 after transplant | Every other month      |
| Second year after transplant         | Every three months     |
| Year three and beyond                | Every six months       |

14 After Your Transplant

![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg)

# **Transplant Clinic Visits**

Before you leave the hospital, you will be given dates for your first 2 months of appointments in the heart transplant clinic. These visits will typically include blood work and a heart biopsy. They may also include a chest X-ray and an EKG (heart rhythm test). While the time involved will vary, it is best to plan to spend an entire day at Duke University Hospital going to all of your appointments. We will try to make each follow-up visit as short as possible.

Please note: During clinic visits we prefer to have your blood work collected before 9:00 am (to get the most accurate levels for your antirejection medications). This means you can arrive as early as 7:30 a.m. on your appointment day.

After that, you may have other appointments in the clinic and at other parts of the hospital. Please anticipate spending most of the morning and early afternoon at Duke during your visits. We will do our very best to see you in a timely manner and coordinate multiple appointments.

## **Preparing for Clinic Visits**

Please follow these instructions for each clinic visit:

![](_page_14_Picture_7.jpeg)

As noted above, it is important to stay hydrated - especially early after transplant. For most clinic visits we encourage you to eat and drink before the visit to ensure you are hydrated. If you are going to the cath lab, you may eat a light snack (toast, crackers) and drink only clear liquids (water, clear tea, black coffee with no milk or cream, or soda) on the morning of your cath lab procedure.

![](_page_14_Picture_9.jpeg)

Do not take your anti-rejection medicines until after your blood is drawn. You should bring your morning dose(s) of anti-rejection medicines with you and take them after your blood is drawn. You may take your other medicines at the usual time.

![](_page_14_Picture_11.jpeg)

Bring at least one day's supply of medicines with you to each clinic visit. If unexpected delays occur, you will then be able to take your medicines without delay.

![](_page_14_Picture_13.jpeg)

Bring your medicine list and expect to discuss it with the coordinator and medical staff at each visit.

![](_page_14_Picture_15.jpeg)

Bring a written list of any questions you have for the providers and transplant coordinators so you can refer to it during your clinic visit.

![](_page_14_Picture_17.jpeg)

Let a member of your transplant team know if you need any prescription refills. They can be sent to your pharmacy electronically during your clinic visit.

![](_page_15_Picture_0.jpeg)

## Labs (Blood Work)

Regardless of where you are in your transplant journey, your blood work/labs will be completed at the beginning of your clinic visits.

These labs will help us make many decisions regarding your care, but most importantly the blood work will tell us if you are on the correct dose of anti-rejection medicine.

For this level to be accurate, you will need to hold (not take) your morning dose of anti-rejection medicines. Please bring them with you so you can take them once your bloodwork is done.

![](_page_15_Picture_5.jpeg)

## **Provider Visit**

After labs are done, we'll take you to a room where you will meet with a transplant clinician. Often, you will also see a transplant coordinator. We will ask you several questions during this time. This is also the time to discuss any questions or concerns you may have, and to request medicine refills.

![](_page_15_Picture_8.jpeg)

## **Biopsy**

For the first year after transplant, your clinic visits will frequently include a biopsy. We have a biopsy suite in clinic where we do the procedure. However, sometimes you will need to go to the cath lab at the hospital for your biopsy.

#### How biopsies are performed

In the Clinic Biopsy Suite: If you are scheduled for a biopsy in the outpatient clinic, the procedure typically takes 30 minutes. You will be awake during the process.

- We'll scrub the right side of your neck with antiseptic soap and inject a numbing medicine to minimize any discomfort you may feel.
- The doctor will insert a plastic tube called an intravenous (IV) catheter into a neck vein. This is easier to do if you have had plenty of fluids to drink before clinic. They will then pass an instrument  $-$  called a bioptome (or biopsy forceps) - through the catheter and guide it to the right side of your heart. An echocardiogram (ECHO) will be done at the same time, to allow the doctor to "see" the bioptome in the heart. The doctor will use the bioptome to take tiny samples of heart tissue to be evaluated for rejection.
- When the biopsy procedure is done, the doctor will remove the catheter. We'll apply pressure to the site on your neck and check your vital signs

(heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, temperature). After that, you can leave the clinic.

• Your neck area may be tender or bruised for a few days after the biopsy.

In the Cath Lab: If we are unable to access your heart through a neck vein in the clinic, you may need to have your heart biopsies done in the cath lab at Duke University Hospital.

- The process is similar to clinic biopsies, but doctors instead will access your heart through an incision in your groin.
- Because this requires a little more sedation (medicine for pain and comfort), we cannot permit you to drive yourself home after the procedure. You will need a driver for each cath lab visit.
- The incision area (the groin) may be tender or bruised for a few days after the biopsy.

#### After your biopsy

After you leave the clinic or hospital, if you begin bleeding or feel pressure at the biopsy site, notify a member of your transplant team while applying gentle pressure at the site. If you feel short of breath or have chest pain after a biopsy procedure, notify your transplant team right away (see page 7).

| ⊠ |  |

|   |  |

## **Additional Tests**

Once you no longer need biopsies, you will have different tests each year to monitor your transplanted heart.

- At year 1, you may have a left heart catheterization, also known as coronary angiogram. You may also have CT angiograms or stress echocardiograms to check for any blockages in the arteries in your heart.
- During years 1 through 3, you may have a blood test to check for rejection. Depending on the results, you may need another biopsy.

![](_page_16_Picture_13.jpeg)

## Clinic Visit Follow-Up

Once all of your test results are done, your heart transplant coordinator and a transplant cardiologist review them. Together, they will decide if you need any changes to your medicine routine, when you should return to clinic, and if you need to have any additional testing. Once this plan is complete, your heart transplant coordinator will discuss the plan with you. Please remember that it often takes a couple of days to have all of your results, and you may see some results in My Duke Health before your plan is done.

# How Can I Help with My Care Plan?

## Home Logs

Keep records of your blood pressure, pulse, and weight (vital signs) if we ask you to. (Only some transplant recipients will need to do this.) If we have asked you to keep home logs of your vital signs, please bring them to each clinic visit. Having current information will help with your care.

## How Can I Help With Communication with Coordinators?

Keep your contact information up to date, and respond to calls and messages promptly. Your coordinators will contact you within a few days after your clinic appointment. Sometimes, the changes to your plan will need to be done right away. Having working and reliable phones is vital for good communication. Please answer any calls that may be from a Duke care team member and make sure your voicemail is set up, so you can listen to any messages team members leave for you.

Your coordinator is your "go-to" person for questions. It is important that you communicate honestly with your team about changes in your health, whether you are taking your medicine as directed, and any concerns you may have. This will help ensure your success as a heart recipient. This includes notifying your team if you have been evaluated in the emergency room or urgent care.

## **Primary Care Provider**

Keep your relationship with your primary care provider (family doctor). This is very important. We may ask that you see them for conditions or medicines that are not directly related to your transplant, such as pain medicines, sleeping aids, insulin, and mental health medicines. This may occur more as time passes after your transplant.

They will also help you to keep up with your health screenings, such as mammograms and colonoscopies. They can also help with referrals to specialties such as psychiatry, dermatology, and orthopedics.

Your primary care provider is also a great resource for when you don't feel well. They can help find out the cause and make a treatment plan if needed.

If your primary care provider starts you on new medicines, it is very important that you contact your transplant coordinator before you begin taking the new medicine as there could be important interactions between these medicines and your anti-rejection medicines.

## What About Outside Lab Testing?

Find a local lab for blood work. Keeping the right levels of your anti-rejection medicines is the key

to success. There will be times when we make changes to your medicines and need you to have more blood tests to make sure the medicines are working within a goal range. Coming to Duke for testing between clinic visits can be inconvenient and costly. To help with this, we will ask you to find a local lab - such as a LabCorp lab, a local hospital or your local clinician's office - where you can have blood work done. Make sure to let your transplant coordinator know what lab location you've chosen. This will allow us to send orders directly to the lab, and to get your results back in a timely manner.

# **General Medicine Guidelines**

You will take medicines to suppress your immune system every day for the rest of your life. You will take other medicines (for example, a daily low-dose aspirin) to keep your new heart – and the rest of your body – healthy.

One of the main causes of rejection is from not taking medicines as directed. Always call your transplant coordinator if you have questions about your medicines.

![](_page_18_Picture_4.jpeg)

![](_page_18_Picture_5.jpeg)

Use the written medicine instructions (provided to you when you left the hospital) for your correct medicine doses. Do not follow the instructions on your pill bottles, as your medicine doses will be changed frequently and the labels may not be current.

![](_page_18_Picture_7.jpeg)

During the first year after transplant, it is normal for your medicine doses to change often. Be sure to write down changes as they are told to you. You can also ask your coordinator for updated written instructions.

Take your medicines as directed.

![](_page_18_Picture_11.jpeg)

Do not skip doses of medicine.

![](_page_18_Picture_13.jpeg)

Do not run out of medicines. Make sure you get them refilled before they are empty. Missing or being late on doses can cause rejection.

![](_page_18_Picture_15.jpeg)

Never crush or cut a tablet unless you're told to do so.

![](_page_18_Picture_17.jpeg)

Never open capsules.

![](_page_19_Picture_0.jpeg)

Discuss any new medicines from other providers with your transplant coordinator before starting them. Never take any over-the-counter (OTC) medicines or supplements, including vitamins and dietary supplements, without first talking with your transplant provider or coordinator, as OTC medicines and supplements may interfere with your transplant medicines.

![](_page_19_Picture_2.jpeg)

Keep a current list of your medicines with you at all times, including all over-thecounter medicines. If you have a smart phone, this might be a useful place to keep your medicine list.

![](_page_19_Picture_4.jpeg)

Call your transplant coordinator if you ever have a problem with paying for your medicines. We will do our best to guide you to resources to help.

# Tips for Remembering Your Medicines

- Get a pillbox with the days of the week and times on it.
  - Fill your pill box once each week.
  - Keep your pillbox in a place where you will see it often during the day.
- If you have a smartphone, you can download and use a medicine reminder app.
- Set an alarm clock, watch timer, or alert on your smartphone to remind you when it is time to take your medicines.

# **Tips for Filling Prescriptions**

## Tacrolimus (Prograf®)

- Tacrolimus is one of the main drugs that prevent rejection.
- You will likely be on tacrolimus after the transplant.
- Tacrolimus is usually taken two times each day, at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
- " Tacrolimus comes in 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg capsules.
- You will have a blood test that shows your tacrolimus drug level. You will have this test after transplant while you are in the hospital and when you come to clinic after you are discharged.

#### Why is a tacrolimus level important?

• To keep the tacrolimus level at or near your identified goal.

- If your tacrolimus level is too high, you may have side effects.
- If your tacrolimus level is too low, you may have rejection.
- The blood test for your tacrolimus level is always taken before your morning dose. The morning dose is typically taken at 9am.
- On clinic days, or whenever the transplant team asks you to get a blood level, you should NOT take your morning dose of tacrolimus until after your blood is drawn. Bring your tacrolimus with you to the lab or clinic appointment and take your dose AFTER your blood is drawn.
- Your dose may change over time based on your tacrolimus level.
- A member of the transplant team will let you know if you need to change your dose.
- Several companies make a generic form of tacrolimus. It is important to pay attention to what your tacrolimus capsules look like. If your tacrolimus capsules look different when you get them refilled, please let the transplant team know. Changing tacrolimus companies can have an effect on your tacrolimus blood level.

#### What are the side effects of tacrolimus?

- You may have side effects from tacrolimus, or you may not have any side effects at all.
- Some of the more common side effects patients notice are:
  - Nausea
  - Headache
  - Tremor (shaking) in your hands
- Many of the side effects can be managed with help from your transplant provider and some lessen or go away with time.
- The transplant team will watch closely for side effects after your transplant and make changes with your medicines to minimize any problems your medicines are causing.
- Always take your tacrolimus as instructed by the transplant team to help prevent side effects.

#### What if I miss a dose?

• If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you can. If more than 4 hours have gone by since your last dose was due, then skip that dose, and take your next dose when it is due.

- Do not take double or extra doses.
- Contact your transplant coordinator if you miss more than one dose, or if you throw up (vomit) a dose.

#### Does tacrolimus interact with any other medicines?

• Yes! Tacrolimus has a lot of drug interactions. This means there are a lot of drugs that can change your blood level of tacrolimus. Some interactions can lead to rejection of your transplant if the tacrolimus levels are low. Some interactions can lead to dangerous side effects from high tacrolimus levels. This is why you should NEVER start any medicine, vitamin, supplement or over-the-counter medicine before talking to your transplant provider or coordinator.

#### Are there foods I should not eat while taking tacrolimus?

• You cannot have grapefruit or grapefruit juice while you are taking tacrolimus. Grapefruit can slow down the metabolism (breakdown) of tacrolimus in your body. This can result in very high blood levels of tacrolimus. Be careful, as grapefruit juice is mixed in some common beverages. Always read the food ingredient labels.

#### Should I take tacrolimus on an empty stomach?

• The best way to take tacrolimus is at the same time each day and consistently with relation to meals. This will help you keep a constant amount of tacrolimus in your body.

#### What do I need to watch for while I take tacrolimus?

- The levels of tacrolimus in your blood need to be checked and you will visit the transplant clinic regularly to do so.
- You will have an increased risk of infection while taking tacrolimus.
- Avoid taking high doses of aspirin (this includes Goody's® powder); the only aspirin we would like you to take is the 81mg we prescribe. Also avoid taking ibuprofen (Advil®), naproxen (Aleve®), or any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) unless instructed to do so by the transplant team.

## Cyclosporine (Neoral®, Gengraf®)

- Cyclosporine is one of the main drugs that prevent rejection. It is very similar to tacrolimus. If you are not on tacrolimus after the transplant, you may be on cyclosporine. You will never be on both at the same time.
- Cyclosporine is usually taken 2 times each day, at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
- Cyclosporine comes in 25 mg and 100 mg capsules and in a liquid.
- You will have a blood test that shows your cyclosporine drug level. You will have this test after transplant while you are in the hospital and when you come to clinic after you are discharged.

#### Why is a cyclosporine level important?

- If your cyclosporine level is too high, you may have side effects.
- If your cyclosporine level is too low, you may have rejection.
- . The blood test for your cyclosporine level is always taken before your morning dose. The morning dose is typically taken at 9am.
- On clinic days or whenever the transplant team asks you to get a cyclosporine blood level checked, you should not take your cyclosporine until after your blood is drawn.
- Your dose may change over time based on your cyclosporine level.
- A member of the transplant team will let you know if you need to change your dose.
- Several companies make a generic form of cyclosporine that may not be equal to each other. It is important to pay attention to what your cyclosporine gel caps look like. If your cyclosporine capsules look different when you get them refilled, please let the transplant team know. Changing cyclosporine companies can have an effect on your cyclosporine blood level.

#### What are the side effects of cyclosporine?

- You may have side effects from cyclosporine, or you may not have any side effects at all.
- Some of the more common side effects patients notice are:
  - Nausea
  - Headache
  - Tremor (shaking) in your hands

- Hair growth on face
- Gum overgrowth
- Many of the side effects can be managed with help from your transplant provider and some lessen or go away with time.
- The transplant team will watch closely for side effects after your transplant.

#### What if I miss a dose?

- If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you can. If more than 4 hours have gone by since your last dose was due, then skip that dose, and take your next dose when it is due.
- Do not take double or extra doses.
- Contact your transplant coordinator if you miss more than one dose, or if you throw up a dose.

#### Does cyclosporine interact badly with any other medicines?

• Yes! Cyclosporine has a lot of drug interactions. That means there are a lot of drugs that can change your blood level of cyclosporine. Some interactions can lead to rejection of your transplant if the cyclosporine levels are low. Some interactions can lead to dangerous side effects from high cyclosporine levels. This is why you should NEVER start any medicine, vitamin, supplement or over-the-counter medicine before talking to your transplant provider or coordinator.

#### Are there foods I should avoid while taking cyclosporine?

• You cannot have grapefruit or grapefruit juice when you take cyclosporine. Grapefruit can slow down the metabolism (breakdown) of cyclosporine in your body. This can cause high blood levels of cyclosporine. Be careful, as grapefruit juice is mixed in some common beverages. Always read the food ingredient labels.

• The best way to take cyclosporine is at the same times each day and consistently with relation to meals. This will help you keep a constant amount of cyclosporine in your body.

#### What do I need to watch for while I take cyclosporine?

• The levels of cyclosporine in your blood need to be checked. You will visit the transplant clinic regularly to do so.

- You will have an increased risk of infection while taking cyclosporine
- Avoid taking high doses of aspirin (this includes Goody's® powder); the only aspirin we would like you to take is the 81mg we prescribe. Also avoid taking ibuprofen (Advil®), naproxen (Aleve®), or any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) unless instructed to do so by the transplant team.
- Cyclosporine can cause unusual growth of gum tissue and can make your gums bleed. Practice good oral hygiene, and be careful when brushing and flossing your teeth. See your dentist regularly.

### Mycophenolate Mofetil (Cellcept®, Myfortic®)

- " You will likely take mycophenolate to prevent rejection.
- You will take mycophenolate twice daily, at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
- Mycophenolate comes in 250 mg capsules, 500 mg tablets, 180 mg and 360 mg tablets, and liquid.

#### What are the side effects of Mycophenolate?

- Mycophenolate's most common side effects are upset stomach, particularly nausea or diarrhea. Taking mycophenolate with food might help prevent stomach upset.
- Mycophenolate can sometimes decrease your blood counts (white blood cells and platelets). The transplant team checks your blood counts when you come to clinic. If your blood counts drop, they may decrease your dose.
- Mycophenolate can cause miscarriage or birth defects to the baby in women who are pregnant and taking the medicine. Transplant patients who could become pregnant MUST avoid pregnancy through abstinence, or highly effective birth control. If there is a female in your household who is pregnant or could be, they should not handle, open or crush mycophenolate tablets or capsules.

#### Does mycophenolate interact with any other medicines?

- Antacids that contain magnesium and aluminum can decrease the absorption of mycophenolate (causing lower levels). These should be taken at least 4 hours apart from mycophenolate.
- Certain cholesterol medicines, such as colestipol and cholestyramine, can decrease the levels of mycophenolate in the body.

![](_page_26_Picture_0.jpeg)

### Prednisone

- You will be on prednisone after your transplant to prevent rejection.
- Prednisone is taken 1 or 2 times each day with food.
- If you are only taking prednisone 1 time each day, take it in the morning to prevent difficulty sleeping at night.
- If you are taking prednisone 2 times each day, take the doses with your morning meal and evening meal.
- Your prednisone dose will gradually decrease over time. Check your medicine schedule for your exact dose each day.

#### What are the side effects of prednisone?

- Prednisone can increase your blood sugar (glucose) and cause or worsen diabetes. Some patients may have to take insulin shots at home and check their sugars with a glucometer after transplant.
- Prednisone can cause osteoporosis (brittle bones). Some patients may already have this before the transplant. If you are taking drugs like alendronate (Fosamax®) or risedronate (Actonel®) before your transplant, you will continue taking those drugs after you are discharged from the hospital. All patients will take a calcium supplement to prevent damage to their bones.
- Prednisone can cause weight gain. Weight gain can be prevented by keeping a healthy diet and exercising on a regular basis.

![](_page_26_Picture_11.jpeg)

## Valganciclovir (Valcyte®)

- Some patients will have to take this medicine to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) after their transplant.
- CMV is a virus that most of us are exposed to at some point in our lives. When you are exposed to it before transplant, CMV can cause mild illness, and it stays in your body for the rest of your life. After the transplant, when your immune system is weak, CMV can flare up and cause severe illness and organ injury.
- Valganciclovir comes in a 450mg tablet and a liquid.
- Valganciclovir should be taken with a full meal. If you are skipping your meal, continue to take valganciclovir at the time you normally would. While you are on valganciclovir, you will need regular blood checks in the transplant clinic to check for low blood counts.

![](_page_27_Picture_0.jpeg)

## Valacyclovir (Valtrex<sup>®</sup>)

- Some patients will have to take this medicine to prevent herpes simplex virus (HSV) after their transplant.
- HSV is a virus that most of us are exposed to at some point and lives in your body for the rest of your life. Although some people with HSV never know they have the infection, it can cause genital ulcers or mouth ulcers (fever blisters). After the transplant, when your immune system is weak, HSV can "wake-up" and cause problems.
- You will never be on both valganciclovir and valacyclovir at the same time.
- Valacyclovir comes in 500 mg and 1000 mg (1 gram) caplets.

![](_page_27_Picture_6.jpeg)

## Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim or SMX/TMP (Septra SS®)

- Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim is taken after transplant to prevent a special kind of pneumonia called Pneumocystis jirovecii. This is a pneumonia that transplant patients can get because of their low immune systems.
- You will take sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for at least 1 year after your transplant.
- If you are allergic to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, which is a "sulfa" drug," you will likely take either atovaquone or dapsone, or inhaled pentamidine instead.
- Sometimes patients may have nausea, but this can be helped by taking sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim with food. It can also cause high potassium levels in the blood, so regular blood tests will be done to look for this.
- Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim can cause increased sensitivity to the sun. Wear protective clothing and use sunscreen outdoors.

![](_page_27_Picture_13.jpeg)

### **Nystatin**

- Nystatin prevents thrush (yeast) from growing in your mouth and throat.
- You will swish and swallow with 5 milliliters (about a teaspoon) of nystatin after each meal and at bedtime.
- After swishing, wait about 15 minutes before eating or drinking.
- You will take nystatin for the first 6 months after your transplant.

![](_page_28_Picture_0.jpeg)

## **Stomach Medicines**

- After the transplant, all patients take a medicine to decrease their stomach acid. These medicines prevent stomach upset and ulcers. This can be a short-term medication after transplant unless you need to continue it for other conditions.
- Examples include pantoprazole (Protonix®) and omeprazole (Prilosec®).
- If you already take a stomach medicine for heartburn or ulcers, we will try to continue your same medicine.

![](_page_28_Picture_5.jpeg)

## Statin (a medicine that lowers cholesterol and can prevent heart disease and strokes)

- After your transplant, you will take a statin medicine. This will usually be pravastatin (Pravachol®) or rosuvastatin (Crestor®), since these have the lowest chance of interaction with your anti-rejection drugs
- Even if you have normal cholesterol, you will take statin drugs to help prevent coronary artery vasculopathy (CAV) after your heart transplant.
- If you have high cholesterol, statin drugs will be used to both lower your cholesterol and help prevent CAV. If you had been taking a different medicine to lower your cholesterol before transplant, you may be switched from that medicine to pravastatin or rosuvastatin after transplant.
- Rarely, people will develop muscle aches and pains when they take a statin. If you develop any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, report it to your transplant coordinator.
- In some cases, other drugs like this will be used and tailored to the patient's specific needs.

![](_page_28_Picture_12.jpeg)

## **Pain Medicine**

- If you have pain after the transplant, acetaminophen (Tylenol®) is safe to take at recommended doses. Do not take more than 3,000mg a day.
- You may be given a prescription for a stronger, narcotic pain medicine. This medicine should only be taken if needed, for more severe pain that acetaminophen does not help.
- Remember to avoid NSAIDS (ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib) unless asked to use one by a transplant team member.

![](_page_29_Picture_0.jpeg)

### **Over-the-Counter Medicines**

- Omeprazole (Prilosec OTC®)
- **Lansoprazole (Prevacid OTC®)**
- Esomeprazole (Nexium OTC®)

#### Do not take any of these over-the-counter medicines:

Do not take any OTC pain relievers except acetaminophen, no more than 3,000mg each day.

Also, don't forget to keep track of acetaminophen in combination cough or cold products. That counts toward your total daily acetaminophen maximum.

#### Do NOT take these decongestants (without consulting your transplant team)

- Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®)
- Phenylephrine (Sudafed PE®, Alka Seltzer Plus®)

#### Do not take these stomach or bowel medicines (without consulting your transplant team)

# **Food Safety**

Food safety is important for everyone - and especially for people who have had organ transplants. Unsafe handling of foods can cause you to get sick.

### Avoid:

- Food that is past the "sell-by," "use-by," or expiration date
- Buffets and foods stored under heat lamps
- Cold deli sandwiches

### Be sure to:

- Buy only juices and dairy products that are pasteurized
- Buy eggs from the refrigerated section of the grocery store

Close attention to these guidelines - and the food-preparation steps below - can further reduce your risk of infection and food-borne illnesses.

# How to Handle and Prepare Foods Safely

To keep yourself safe at home, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends these 4 easy steps:

- Clean: Wash your hands and surfaces often. Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running water.
- Separate: Separate raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs from other foods. They can spread germs.
- Cook all food thoroughly.
- Chill: Refrigerate all foods right away to slow the growth of harmful bacteria.

# Nutrition After Heart Transplant

Help take care of your transplanted heart by following these nutrition guidelines.

![](_page_32_Picture_2.jpeg)

# **Transplant Medicines and Your Diet**

Good diet control is important after transplant, because anti-rejection medicines:

- Cause your body to hold salt and water
- May increase hunger and cause weight gain due to overeating
- May increase the amount of sugar, cholesterol, and fats in your blood

![](_page_32_Picture_8.jpeg)

# Maintaining a Healthy Weight

It's also important to your overall health that you stay at a healthy body weight. If you need help losing weight, talk to our transplant dietitian. They can guide you on ways to lose weight safely and effectively.

![](_page_32_Picture_11.jpeg)

# Good Nutrition After Transplant

Here are some guidelines for getting good nutrition after your heart transplant.

![](_page_32_Picture_14.jpeg)

## **Get Enough Protein Daily**

Your body needs protein to heal from surgery, and to help strengthen muscles and organ tissues. Your steroid medicines can have a negative effect on muscles and break down muscle protein. A high-protein diet can help overcome this. Include a high-protein food at all meals. Good sources of protein include:

- Lean meat, fish, chicken
- Tofu
- Beans, nuts, peanut butter
- Low-fat dairy products

![](_page_33_Picture_0.jpeg)

### Reduce Concentrated Carbohydrates and Sugars

Prednisone, one of the medicines you will take after your transplant, is often associated with an increase in the level of sugar in your blood. It is recommended that you limit the amount of concentrated sweets and sugars in your diet and control the amount of carbohydrates you eat to help keep a healthy blood sugar level.

Carbohydrates are found in sugar, fruit, breads, crackers, cereals, pasta, rice, grains, milk and yogurt, and starchy vegetables such as potatoes, corn, beans, and peas. You don't need to completely cut out these foods, but you should control the amount you eat at each meal/snack. Aim for about 30 to 75 grams of carbohydrate at each meal, with most coming from whole grains/whole wheat. Use nutrition labels to learn about the carbohydrate content of foods. Make sure you compare the serving size you are eating to the serving size on the label.

Limit your intake of soda, candies, desserts, and fruit juices.

![](_page_33_Picture_5.jpeg)

## Pay Attention to Fat and Cholesterol

Reducing the overall amount of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol in your diet is recommended in order to maintain a healthy blood cholesterol level. You can lower your blood cholesterol levels by using polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, such as olive and canola oil, in place of saturated fat (butter) in your diet.

- Cholesterol and saturated fats are found in animal foods. It is recommended that you reduce your intake of foods such as high-fat red meats, high-fat dairy products, and egg yolks (eat no more than 4 egg yolks per week).
- Avoid trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils), which are found in many processed foods. The amount of trans fat in a food is listed on the "Nutrition Facts" label.
- Choose healthy fats from fatty fish (such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and tuna), walnuts, flaxseed, chia seed, canola oil, and olive oil. Eat 1 to 2 servings of fatty fish per week.
- Choose foods that are baked, grilled, steamed, broiled, or boiled rather than deep fried.
- Read food labels and choose foods that contain:
  - Less than 5 g total fat per serving
  - 0 to 3 grams saturated and trans fat per serving

![](_page_34_Picture_0.jpeg)

## **Restrict Sodium (Salt) Intake**

Dietary sodium (salt) can cause you to retain fluid and may cause swelling and high blood pressure. Read nutrition labels to be aware of the sodium content of foods. Choose foods that contain less than 300 mg sodium per serving. When possible, choose fresh or frozen beans or vegetables (without sauces) instead of canned.

![](_page_34_Picture_3.jpeg)

## Avoid consuming these foods in excess, as they are high in sodium:

- Cured, smoked, and canned meats
- Most cheeses (Swiss cheese is lowest in sodium), especially processed cheese (American cheese)
- Canned soups, vegetables, and sauces
- Fast food and pre-packaged convenience foods like frozen meals, pizzas, and instant noodles
- Chips and crackers
- Foods with sauces

![](_page_34_Picture_11.jpeg)

## Increase the Amount of Calcium in Your Diet

Osteoporosis (low bone mass) is a common after-effect of long-term steroid use. Dairy products or dairy alternatives such as soy are excellent sources of calcium and should be included in your diet to help keep your bones strong. Aim for 1200-1500 mg/day of calcium plus vitamin D from your diet and/or a calcium supplement.

![](_page_34_Picture_14.jpeg)

# Prevent Food-Drug Interactions

Avoid the following due to their interaction with a group of anti-rejection medicines (calcineurin inhibitors):

## Foods, Herbs, and Sodas to Avoid

These interact with anti-rejection medicines.

| <b>Fruits</b>                  | <b>Herbal Products</b> | Sodas                |

# Post-Transplant Activities

During your heart transplant, the nerves to your heart were cut and are not likely to grow back. The medical term for this is "denervation." Your body will now use hormones to regulate how your heart responds to activity.

There are some changes that may take some time to get used to.

- Sour resting heart rate will be faster  $-$  often between 90 and 110 beats per minute  $$ which is normal early after transplant.
- It will take longer for your heart to speed up, usually 5 to 10 minutes.

- Your target heart rate may not be reached during vigorous exercise.
- It will take longer for you to cool down, usually 5 to 10 minutes.
- You may become lightheaded or dizzy if you change position too quickly.

# Physical Activity

Regular exercise is important. Around 6-weeks post-discharge, we will refer you to a cardiac rehab program. This program will give you guidance on how to exercise safely. Below are some tips and reminders.

Exercise will help you:

- Strengthen your heart and other muscles
- Increase energy
- Relieve stress and tension
- Reduce high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugars

For the first 6 weeks after discharge, do not:

- Lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk (around 10 pounds) check with your team before resuming heavy lifting
- Push or pull anything heavier than 10 pounds
- · Do sit-ups, pull-ups, or push-ups
- · Drive
- Go into a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool unless your incisions have healed (check with your team)

### **Exercise Safety**

- Pace yourself. After surgery you need to take things slowly.
- Rest when you are tired.
- For the first 2 months, avoid contact sports or any activity that could result in a blow to the chest.
- Avoid any activity that causes discomfort in your incision.

![](_page_36_Picture_21.jpeg)

• Women should wear a supportive bra for physical activities to protect your breastbone (sternum) while it heals.

### **Types of Exercise**

Your exercise program should be one that uses large muscle groups. Following surgery, it will take time to build your endurance. When you first leave the hospital, try to walk for 5 to 10 minutes each day. As this becomes easier, gradually increase the time until it becomes 30 to 45 minutes a day, at least 3 days a week.

Options other than walking include:

- Stationary bike
- Low-impact aerobics

## Stretching, Warming Up, & Cooling Down

Warming up muscles before exercise and cooling them down and stretching after exercise will reduce the likelihood of injury to muscles and tendons. Stretching will also improve your flexibility over time and can reduce pain. Stretches should be slow and gentle.

Warm-up exercises increase your circulation and body temperature. The exercise should be low intensity and can include stretching. This will gradually raise your heart rate over 5 to 10 minutes and help avoid injuring muscles.

![](_page_37_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Driving** 

Do not drive for at least 6 weeks following transplant.

When you are in the car be sure to wear a seatbelt.

### Sex

You may resume sexual activity when you get home. Avoid bearing weight with your arms, and

stress, pressure, or strain on your surgical incision. These restrictions are for the first 6-weeks following transplant.

Practicing safe sex will help protect you from sexually transmitted infections. Safe sex means using a condom and avoiding highrisk behaviors such as having multiple sexual partners.

If you feel that you don't have your normal sex drive, please let your transplant team know.

Erectile dysfunction (difficulty with getting or maintaining an erection) can be caused by some of the medicines you take after

![](_page_38_Picture_4.jpeg)

transplant, but we can work with you to determine a treatment plan.

If you are a woman of childbearing age, it is important that you use birth control after transplant. Many of the medicines you will be taking can harm a fetus (developing baby). If you would like to use a form of birth control other than condoms, be sure to discuss this with your transplant team and your gynecologist.

![](_page_38_Picture_7.jpeg)

#### **Returning to Work**

Your timeline for returning to work will depend on the type of work you do. Please discuss your plans to return to work with your transplant team.

# Health Maintenance After Transplant

Having a primary care physician (PCP) will help ensure your success post-transplant. Your PCP will be your resource for medicines not directly related to transplant. Examples of those medicines include: sleeping aids, anxiety or depression medicines, insulin, and pain medicines.

Your PCP will also help keep you up to date on your general health screenings, and be your resource if you feel unwell.

# **Health Screenings**

Skin Inspections: Completely inspect your skin at least 1 time each month. Report any new sores, any new or changing areas of discoloration of moles, new lumps or bumps, or a wound that does not heal.

See a dermatologist (skin doctor) for an annual skin check.

Colorectal Cancer Screening: Beginning at age 45, you should have testing for colorectal cancer.

![](_page_39_Picture_7.jpeg)

Mammograms: Beginning at age 40, those whose birth sex is female should have yearly mammograms.

Pelvic Exam and Pap Smear: Starting at age 21, those whose birth sex is female should have yearly gynecologic examinations. These should include pelvic exams and Pap smears according to current guidelines.

Prostate Exam: Starting at age 45, those whose birth sex is male should have yearly prostatespecific antigen (PSA) blood tests, to screen for prostate enlargement or cancer.

Dental: See a dentist for an exam and cleaning twice a year.

Vision: Visit your eye doctor for an exam once a year.

### Vaccinations

Avoid any live virus vaccinations. Examples include vaccines for: measles, mumps, rubella, and

varicella (chicken pox).

Influenzas (Flu): We recommend you get a flu vaccine every fall.

Tdap (Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis): Everyone should receive this vaccine every 10 years.

Pneumococcal Vaccine (Pneumovax): This helps prevent a type of pneumonia called pneumococcus. You should receive this vaccine every 5 years.

Hepatitis: The hepatitis virus infects your liver and can lead to liver failure. There are vaccines against both type A (2-shot series) and type B (3-shot series) hepatitis. We recommend you be vaccinated against both these types of hepatitis. Currently, there is no vaccine against Hepatitis C.

Shingles: Must be the Shingrix 2-shot version. (The single-shot version contains live virus.)

COVID: Vaccination according to CDC guidelines is recommended.

If you have or spend time with young children, please note:

- Children who have received injectable (shots) live vaccines do not put you at risk.
- If a child has received an inhaled flu vaccine, don't put your face close to theirs or do their diaper changes until 2 weeks after they received the vaccine.
- If a child has received the rotavirus oral vaccine, do not do their diaper changes for 4 weeks after they received the vaccine.

# **Healthy Lifestyle Habits**

![](_page_40_Picture_12.jpeg)

## Sun Exposure

After your transplant, you will be at increased risk of skin cancer because of your anti-rejection medicines. To minimize your risk, wear protective clothing and a UVA/UVB sunscreen (SPF of 30 or greater) on all exposed skin. Wear a hat when you're outside for long periods of time, especially if you have thinning hair.

![](_page_40_Picture_15.jpeg)

## **Smoking**

Before you were placed on the transplant waiting list, the transplant team talked to you about tobacco use and told you that you cannot use tobacco products after you receive a new heart. Heart transplant recipients who smoke or use tobacco products are damaging the healthy new heart that was donated to them. Even secondhand exposure can lead to poor outcomes.

PLEASE honor your pre-transplant commitment to care for your new heart and DO NOT SMOKE.

![](_page_41_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### Alcohol

You may drink alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer, and mixed drinks, but it should be no more than 1 drink each day.

A drink is defined as one of the following:

- 12 fl. oz. of regular beer
- 8 to 9 fl. oz. of malt liquor
- 5 fl. oz. of wine
- 1.5 fl. oz. of distilled spirits (liquor)

![](_page_41_Picture_8.jpeg)

## Pets

If you have always enjoyed having a pet or pets in the house, there is no reason for that to change. However, you should follow some guidelines to prevent infection.

- Do not pick up any pet waste, clean out litter boxes, bird cages or fish tanks.
- Make sure your pet has regular check-ups. Avoid exposure to live vaccines, such as the Bordetella vaccine.
- Wash your hands after handling your pet.
- Keep your overall number of pets to a minimum. Just as having too many people in house can be unhealthy, so can having too many pets.

![](_page_41_Picture_15.jpeg)

## **Traveling**

When you feel well enough to begin traveling, your transplant team will discuss safety precautions with you.

![](_page_41_Picture_18.jpeg)

## Gardening

Avoid digging in the dirt or construction areas for the first 6 months after transplant. The ground has fungal spores that can be released into the air and inhaled, causing lung infection.

After 6 months, you may begin to garden, but you should wear a mask and gloves.

Wash your hands thoroughly and change your clothes after your gardening activities are complete.

Fresh cut flowers can pose a risk. You may have them in your home, but ask someone else to care for them to lessen your risk.

# Infection Risks and Prevention

Your anti-rejection medicines allow your body to accept your new heart. However, they also make you more likely to develop an infection. Over time, this risk is lowered, but it never goes away completely.

![](_page_42_Picture_2.jpeg)

# Handwashing

The most important thing you can do to prevent infection is wash your hands. Using soap and clean water is best, but you can use hand sanitizers too. You should wash your hands after contact with another person, before and after meals, before preparing and taking your medicines, and after using the restroom. Ask your family and friends to join in the fight against infections and insist everyone wash their hands too.

![](_page_42_Picture_5.jpeg)

# Dental Care

It is important to brush and floss your teeth each day to prevent any overgrowth of bacteria. We recommend waiting 6 months after your transplant before having a routine dental appointment.

Please contact your transplant coordinator to discuss whether you need antibiotics before dental work and to get a prescription, if necessary.

![](_page_42_Picture_9.jpeg)

# Wounds

Your body's ability to heal wounds is slowed down due to your anti-rejection medicines. Clean minor cuts and scrapes with soap and water and cover them with a clean, dry dressing.

You may use antibiotic ointment on superficial wounds to reduce the risk of a more serious infection.

If the wound develops swelling, a foul odor, pus, or redness, call your transplant coordinator.

![](_page_42_Picture_14.jpeg)

# **Water Safety**

Water safety is important in the post-transplant period. We have 3 phases of water-based precautions at Duke.

• Phase 1: In hospital, post-transplant, immune system very suppressed, freshly healing wounds

- Expect tight water restrictions. Drinking water will be sterile, and limits to ice chips and bathing will be enforced.
- Phase 2: Immediate post-discharge from hospital, incisional staples still in place
  - Use city tap water or bottled water for drinking and oral care
  - Use water that has been boiled and cooled or sterile water for tube flushes and washing wounds
  - Showers and baths are not recommended in this phase
  - Chest tube sites and incisions should be cleaned only with sterile water or water that has been boiled and cooled
- Phase 3: Staples are removed and incisions are healed
  - Showering and bathing are allowed

![](_page_43_Picture_8.jpeg)

# Other Infection Prevention Tips

- Avoid people who are sick. If family or friends feel ill, ask them not to visit until they are feeling better.
- If you are in an enclosed or crowded area and someone near you is coughing or sneezing, move several feet away and consider wearing a mask.
- If you have well water, it will need to be tested for pathogens (germs that could make you sick) to ensure it is safe to drink or use in preparing food. Any local well servicing company should be able to provide this testing for a fee.
- Limit time in hot tubs (less than 10 minutes) due to the aerosols (mist in the air) that are produced and could be harmful. Avoid - or limit the time you spend – swimming in lakes and ponds for the same reason.

# Types of Infection

#### Opportunistic infections

These are caused by common bacteria, viruses, and fungi that float in the air or live on your skin, or in the dirt or water. Common types of these infections include Pneumocystis pneumonia and toxoplasmosis. You will be on medicines to help prevent these types of infections.

#### Re-activated infections

We all are exposed to many different infection-causing germs in our lifetimes. Sometimes these germs stay in your body, but your immune system has kept them from making you sick.

After transplant, because your immune system is suppressed, these organisms can re-activate and make you sick. Some examples of these organisms are:

- Herpes simplex (cold sores or fever blisters)
- Herpes zoster (shingles)
- Cytomegalovirus (CMV)

### Skin infections

There are 3 common skin infections after transplant:

Herpes: The herpes virus is present in 8 out of 10 people but does not always cause symptoms until the immune system is suppressed. If you develop an active herpes infection with symptoms, it can be treated with pills or creams, although it is likely to recur.

Warts: Warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and look like small, rough skin-colored lumps. Treatment depends on the size and location of the warts. Like herpes, warts are likely to recur.

Acne: Acne is often caused by taking prednisone. Prednisone causes changes in your skin and increases oil production. When this oil is trapped in your skin follicles, you see acne. It is most common on the trunk of your body but can appear anywhere. The best prevention is good hygiene. Steroid-induced acne can be treated with retinoid or antibiotic creams.

# **Emotional Health**

The transplant journey brings up many different emotions for patients and their families. It is normal for this occur, and it will vary from person to person.

Feelings of sadness, frustration, depression, or anxiety are normal reactions to this journey. It is important to understand these feelings and learn how to manage them.

If you are having these feelings, know you are not alone. Talk with your transplant team and we will work with you to find a management technique that works best for you.

# The Role of Your Caregiver

A reliable, committed support person is required for your success through the transplant process.

By the time you are discharged from the hospital, your caregiver will have learned:

- What your medicines do and their side effects
- How to check your blood sugars, and give medicines if needed
- How to care for your transplant incisions as you heal

![](_page_45_Picture_6.jpeg)

- How to help you take your medicines exactly the way you are supposed to
- Why it's important to go with you to doctor visits and tips for discussing any concerns you may have
- How to help you watch for signs of organ rejection or any other medical issues

Being a caregiver comes with its own questions, concerns, and stresses. The Duke Health Caregiver Support Program is available to your caregiver free of charge. Program staff can connect them with verified service organizations and resources at Duke Health and in our local community. They can help your caregiver with guidance concerning home care, emotional support, and education about illnesses. Your caregiver won't be alone as they assist you throughout the transplant process. For more information about the Caregiver Support Program, call 919-660-2936.

# Monitoring Vital Signs

Measurements of your body's functions - such as blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), temperature, and fluid status (weight)  $-$  are called vital signs.

We ask that you have the supplies at home to monitor your vital signs. If you are not feeling well, we will ask that you check your vital signs. This will also help you become familiar with your equipment in the event we ask you to keep a log.

# **Blood Pressure (BP)**

If we ask you to monitor your blood pressure at home, you will need to get a blood pressure cuff that you can easily use to monitor your own blood pressure.

Use a semi-automatic blood pressure cuff that runs on batteries or electricity. With a semi-automatic cuff, you can put the cuff on your arm and pump it up. The machine then causes the cuff to deflate on its own and displays the BP reading. There are many good brands

![](_page_46_Picture_3.jpeg)

of semi-automatic BP cuffs available for \$35-\$95. Cuffs can be purchased in many drug stores, hospital supply stores, or at discount stores with pharmacy services. Store personnel can help you make an appropriate selection.

Become familiar with your usual blood pressure and pulse rate. Blood pressure readings have two parts. The top number is called the systolic blood pressure; the bottom number is called the diastolic blood pressure.

Always check your vital signs while you are at rest (sitting still). In most instances, we do not need to know how your pressure changes with exercise. Sit and rest for at least five minutes before checking your vital signs.

# When to Call

![](_page_46_Picture_8.jpeg)

### **Blood Pressure**

In the period immediately before your transplant, your blood pressure was probably low because your heart was too weak to pump your blood effectively. However, many people develop high blood pressure (hypertension) after heart transplantation. Since a single blood pressure reading taken during a clinic visit may be falsely high, we will depend on your home records to adjust your medicines.

- A high BP reading is 160/100 (or higher). If you have more than 3 high readings in 1 week, call the transplant office at 919-613-7777 between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., and ask to talk to a coordinator.
- A very high BP reading is 180/120 (or higher). If you get a very high reading, check your blood pressure cuff to make sure it is working correctly. Relax a few minutes and then recheck your pressure. If it remains 160/100 or higher, contact your transplant coordinator. If it's after hours, page the heart transplant cardiologist by calling 919-684-8111 (Duke Operator). Ask for the heart transplant cardiologist on call.

![](_page_47_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### Temperature

Your temperature is generally lowest in the morning and highest in the evening. If you have recurring temperatures at or above 100°F or a single temperature greater than 101°F, you should call the coordinator who is on call to discuss this and any other symptoms you may have.
