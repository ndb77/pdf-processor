![](_page_1_Figure_0.jpeg)

## **Congratulations!**

You have successfully come through surgery. Now begins the recovery process and life with your new heart.

This book is meant to help you and your care partners understand the process. It will help teach you what you need to know about taking care of yourself, and serve as a reference guide for common questions.

Considering the magnitude of the surgery and depending on the amount of time you and your family had to prepare for your transplant, you may be feeling somewhat overwhelmed. Remember, you need to heal emotionally, mentally and spiritually as well as physically.

Although patients want to return to a "normal" lifestyle" immediately, in truth it will take time. It may be several months before you begin to feel you have regained your strength and have a good understanding of how to manage your treatment. However, you will leave the hospital with a sound knowledge of your medicines, your diet and your basic cares.

As one patient commented, "You are not trading your situation for one that is medical free, but, in fact, you are changing from having to cope with a chronic illness to chronic management."

The good news is that you will hopefully be able to have a quality  $-$  filled life and resume some of the previous activities that you enjoyed before you became so ill. This will take some time, patience and a lot of hard work.

During the time immediately following your transplant it may be helpful for you and your family to speak with another post-transplant patient and their family, participate in a transplant support group, discuss your concerns with the transplant team coordinators, social worker, psychologist or our chaplain services. You may be surprised to hear how normal your feelings are, but it is vital to have your feelings and concerns addressed. It is important to receive acknowledgement that this is just another transition in your life and that it will take time to get comfortable with all the new changes.

### Once again, congratulations.

It amazes me that heart transplantation can be done right here in the midwest.

## **What is rejection?**

One of the possible complications that you can develop after transplantation is rejection. Rejection is the normal reaction of the body to a foreign object. Your immune system is how your body fights and destroys germs such as bacteria and viruses. To allow the donor organ to successfully live in your body, medications must be given to trick your immune system into accepting the transplanted organ and not think it is a foreign object.

Antibodies are found in your blood and they try to protect you from anything they don't recognize as part of you. Your immune system cannot differentiate between good and bad cells, therefore your transplanted heart is seen as a threat. Taking your anti-rejection medications as prescribed and getting appropriate lab draws when told by your transplant team IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to protect and prevent rejection. Rejection is treatable with immunosuppression.

Before you received your new heart, blood was taken from you to determine your blood type and antibodies that may have already formed in your body. A cross-match test was done when the donor was found to see if you would have a reaction to the donor heart.

### Rejection can be acute or chronic

Rejection that occurs in the first weeks to months after transplant is called acute. Acute transplant rejection is an expected part of the recovery process and can develop at anytime. To allow the donor organ to successfully live in your body, medications must be given to trick your immune system into accepting the transplant and not think it is a foreign object. Preventing and treating acute rejection may prevent or reduce the possibility of chronic rejection.

**Chronic** rejection occurs later after the transplant. It is somewhat common and develops more gradually and can go on for months or years. It often presents like coronary artery disease.

Chronic rejection is commonly referred to as CAV (cardiac allograft vasculopathy). CAV is different from normal coronary artery disease as the arteries in your heart narrow and become hardened instead of being blocked by plague. You may not feel chest pain due to the denervation of your new transplanted heart, but you may have symptoms like shortness of breath or fatigue.

A left heart catheterization will diagnose CAV. You will have had this done at your annual for the first couple of years. Stress tests are used to assess the possibility of CAV the further you are out from transplant.

### Rejection is treatable with immunosuppression

Since rejection is caused by your immune system, we call methods to prevent it **immunosuppression.** Many of the medications you are taking are given to prevent this antigenantibody reaction from occurring. You received powerful medications in your vein before you went to surgery and have been receiving them ever since. You are on a plan particularly suited to your needs. You may use different immunosuppressive combinations and dosages at various times. The ideal goal of an individual medication plan is to hold back organ rejection while reducing drug toxicity and the risk for infection. See the chapter on Medications for more information on this subject.

### Recognizing rejection as soon as possible is very important

Episodes of rejection of your transplanted organ occur at random times following surgery, and are most frequent within the first few weeks or months after surgery. There is no one laboratory test or symptom to definitely detect cardiac rejection. The microscopic examination of tissue obtained by cardiac biopsy is the only reliable method currently available to diagnose if rejection is developing or decreasing. See the Testing chapter for more information.

### You must know and report the symptoms of rejection

The following are the most common signs and symptoms of rejection. However, each person may experience symptoms differently.

### Symptoms may include any or all of the following:

- Feeling like you did prior to transplant with heart failure symptoms
- Worsening shortness of breath
- Weight gain greater than 3 pounds overnight or 5 pounds total
- Swelling in legs, ankles, feet or abdomen
- More tired than normal in the absence of normal sleep patterns
- Fast or irregular heartbeat/palpitations
- Temperature of 2 degrees higher than baseline
- Flu-like symptoms including chills, aches, fever, dizziness and nausealvomiting
- Feeling "off," "lousy" or "not right"

You may notice that many of these signs are the same as those you experienced before your heart transplant. It does not mean that your new heart will fail, it just means you need to get medical attention immediately.

Also, remember that other minor illnesses can get worse and lead to rejection so don't ignore these. It is always best to call the office and get advice from the transplant coordinator if you have any change in condition.

## **Rejection** continued

### Rejection treatment works best when begun early

Recognizing rejection as soon as possible is vitally important to decrease the effect it has on your transplanted organ. Treatment works best when begun as soon as possible.

### **Treatment of Rejection**

The treatments for rejection can vary based on the type of rejection and time of onset. Rejection treatment can vary from patient to patient. Depending on the rejection you may need to be admitted to the hospital for treatment. Treatments for rejection can include the following:

- Increased dosages of steroids, by mouth or intravenous
- Change in immunosuppressant medications or addition of another medication
- Plasmapheresis process; that attempts to "clean antibodies out of your blood"
- Other Intravenous medications

With early detection and good medical care, rejection can be brought under control. It is important to notify your transplant team as soon as you feel like you may be experiencing any symptoms that could be related to rejection. Clear communication with your transplant team is essential.

### In summary

- Rejection is an expected part of recovery
- Take all medication and get your labs drawn as instructed to avoid rejection

• You play the most important part in your health-care plan  $-$  stay calm and healthy and keep in touch with the transplant team

## **Medications after transplant**

Medications play an important role after transplant. Some of them will be taken for the rest of your life to prevent your body from rejecting your new heart and to treat any other medical conditions you may have. Always continue to take your medications as directed, and never stop or start a medication or change your dose without approval from the transplant team. If you miss a dose of medication always let the the transplant team know as soon as possible.

### Before leaving the hospital you should know:

- The names of the medications
- The dose of each medication
- When to take each medication
- What each medication is used for
- Possible side effects

### Medications to prevent rejection (also called immunosuppressants or anti-rejection medications)

These are a group of medications that will keep your new heart from being rejected as a foreign object by your body's natural immune system. They are essential to keep your new heart alive. You will take three medications to prevent rejection.

- Tacrolimus (Prograf)
- Prednisone (Deltasone)
- Mycophenolate (Cellcept)

### Medications to prevent infection

These are a group of medications that help to prevent infections in your body. They are given because your body's immune system will not be able to fight off infection as well while you are taking anti-rejection medications. You will take two medications to prevent infection; one to prevent bacterial and fungal infections, one to prevent viral infections.

![](_page_6_Figure_17.jpeg)

![](_page_7_Picture_0.jpeg)

### Uses

Tacrolimus (Prograf) is used to prevent or treat rejection. It suppresses the body's immune response to the transplanted heart.

### Schedule

Tacrolimus is taken twice a day. Each dose should be taken 12 hours apart. For example, you should take your morning dose at 8 a.m. and your evening dose at 8 p.m.

You must have your tacrolimus level checked 12 hours after taking your evening dose of medication prior to taking the morning dose. For example, if you take your evening dose at 9 p.m., you will need to have your labs drawn at 9 a.m. prior to taking your morning dose of tacrolimus

### Dose Changes and Lab Monitoring

Your dose of tacrolimus will change based on a blood level drawn by the lab.

### **Tacrolimus** (Prograf, also called "FK" or "FK-506")

### Possible Side Effects of Tacrolimus

- Headaches
- Tremors
- Numb or tingling hands/feet
- Hair loss

Prednisone

(Deltasone)

## **Medications** continued

### Uses

Prednisone (Deltasone) is a steroid and is used to prevent or treat rejection. It suppresses the body's immune response to the transplanted heart.

### Schedule

Prednisone may be taken with food to reduce stomach discomfort and usually is taken once a day. You will eventually be weaned off of your prednisone. In some cases patients stay on long term.

### Dose Changes and Lab Monitoring

Your prednisone dose will change based on your biopsies. If your biopsy shows no rejection, the transplant team will lower your prednisone dose. Likewise, if your biopsy shows rejection, your prednisone dose may be increased.

## Possible Side Effects of Prednisone

- Increase in appetite
- Weight gain
- Water retention (swelling in ankles/feet)
- Round face or "chubby cheeks"
- Mood changes or anxiety
- Trouble sleeping
- Night sweats
- Vision changes and cataracts
- Osteoporosis
- Increased risk of infection
- Increase in cholesterol levels
- High blood sugar
- Stomach irritation/ulcers

### **Special Notes**

It is dangerous to stop taking prednisone all at once. Check with transplant team for any drug interactions before taking any new medications, including herbals.

## Nebraska<sup>.</sup><br>Medicine

## **Medications** continued

### Uses

**Sirolimus** 

(Rapamune)

## **Medications** continued

### Uses

Sirolimus (Rapamune) is an alternate medication used to prevent rejection. It can be used in combination with tacrolimus or separately.

### Schedule

Sirolimus is usually taken once a day. If you take tacrolimus (Prograf), you can take sirolimus at the same time. You must have your sirolimus level checked 24 hours after taking your medication prior to taking the morning dose. For example, if you take your medication at 9 a.m. you will get your labs drawn the next morning at 9 a.m. prior to taking your sirolimus.

### Dose Changes and Lab Monitoring

Your dose of sirolimus will change based on a blood level drawn by the lab.

### Possible Side Effects of Sirolimus

- Stomach discomfort or heartburn
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Headaches
- Tremors
- High blood pressure
- Water retention (swelling in ankles/feet)
- Abnormal kidney function
- Increased risk of infection
- Increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels

### **Schedule**

Valganciclovir is usually taken once daily with food.

Valganciclovir

### Possible Side Effects of Valganciclovir

- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Decrease in white blood cell count

### **Special Notes**

Your transplant team will monitor your blood cell counts while you take this medication. Report any unusual bleeding or bruising.

![](_page_13_Picture_0.jpeg)

### Uses

Valacyclovir (Valtrex) and acyclovir (Zovirax) are used to prevent viral infections, including herpes simplex viruses and shingles.

### Schedule

Valacyclovir and acyclovir are taken several times per day and will be determined by the transplant team. You will take it for three months posttransplant

### Dose Changes and Lab Monitoring

Your acyclovir dose will generally not change during the course of therapy unless you are having intolerable side effects or your kidney function changes.

### **Acyclovir or Valacyclovir** $(Zovirax)$ $(Valtrex)$

### Possible Side Effects of Acyclovir or Valacyclovir

• Headaches

- Nausea/vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Dizziness/fatigue
- Confusion or mood changes

### **Special Notes**

Check with transplant team for any drug interactions before taking any new medications, including herbals.

### **High Blood Pressure Medications**

The medications that you take to prevent rejection can cause high blood pressure as a side effect. The transplant team will determine if you need a medication for high blood pressure and which one is right for you.

### **High Blood Sugar Medications**

The medications you take to prevent rejection can sometimes cause high blood sugar levels. It is not uncommon for transplant patients to require oral anti-diabetic medications and/or insulin daily. If you are taking these medications they need to be managed by your endocrinologist or primary care physician to keep your blood glucose levels under control.

### **Antacids/Anti-ulcer Medications**

You are taking many medications that may cause stomach irritation, especially prednisone. You will usually be prescribed the following medication to protect your stomach: famotidine (Pepcid) or Pantoprazole (Protonix). Once you are off prednisone this medication may be discontinued if you are not having stomach issues.

### **Other Routine Medications**

### **Vitamins and Supplements**

The medications that you take to prevent rejection can also cause low magnesium levels in the blood stream. The transplant team may prescribe a magnesium supplement to boost your magnesium levels. Also, the Prednisone can increase the risk of osteoporosis; therefore, the transplant team may prescribe a calcium supplement with vitamin D to promote healthy bones. A daily multi-vitamin is another common medication.

### Aspirin

Most transplant patients will need to take a baby strength aspirin each day to promote a healthy heart and to help prevent cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV).

### **Anxiety or Depression Medications**

The transplant team will help you decide if you would benefit from a medication that treats anxiety or depression. Patients who already take these medications prior to transplant should continue to take them after transplant unless instructed otherwise by your transplant team.

### **Cholesterol-lowering Medications**

All transplant patients will take a medication to lower cholesterol, which can lower the risk of heart attack and stroke and help prevent cholesterol buildup in arteries. These medications also help prevent long term rejection.

![](_page_15_Picture_0.jpeg)

### Headache or Muscle Aches or Pains

You may take Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a pain medication that is prescribed by the transplant team. Do not take more that 3,000 mg of acetaminophen per 24 hours. Do not take ibuprofen (Motrin), ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve) or any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication. These medications can interact with your transplant medications or harm your kidneys.

### Constipation

You may take docusate, Metamucil, Fiber-Con or Senokot for constipation. Exercising, drinking plenty of water and increasing fiber in your diet are other remedies to help constipation. Contact the transplant team if constipation persists.

### Diarrhea

We do not want you to take medications like Ioperamide (Imodium) or Bismuth (Pepto Bismol) without first consulting with the transplant team. Diarrhea can be caused by a number of different infections and it is your body's way of getting rid of the infection.

### Allergy/Cold Symptoms

### Do not use Afrin nasal spray. Do not use any

medications with a decongestant because they can increase blood pressure. Common decongestants are pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine or products that have D attached to the name, such as Claritin-D. You may take other over-the-counter

### Over-the-counter **Medications**

(OTC) medications for allergy and cold symptoms, or use saline nasal spray. Call the transplant team immediately if you have persistent, cough/cold symptoms, fever, increased shortness of breath or yellow/green drainage because you may have an infection that requires antibiotics.

### Herbal Medications/ Supplements and **Herbal Teas**

Do not use any herbal products or teas, because there may be an interaction between your transplant medications and these products, which may be harmful to yourself and your new heart. Do not take probiotics or elderberry supplements.

## **Other Routine Medications**

### **Pregnancy and Transplant Medications**

Most medications used after transplant can pose a risk to an unborn baby as it develops in the mother's womb. Some of the medications can even affect the fertility of a male transplant patient. Always check with your transplant physician before planning a pregnancy and contact them immediately if you think you are pregnant.

### Medication Dos and Don'ts

- Always continue to take your medications as directed; never stop or start a medication or change your dose without approval from the transplant team
- If a doctor other than your transplant physician prescribes a medication for you, check with your transplant team before taking that medication
- Keep a list of your medications handy, the directions and the times you take them and bring the list with you to each appointment. Be sure to update the list anytime a change is made
- If you miss a dose, contact the transplant team  $\bullet$ for instructions. Remember, it is best to stay on schedule with all your medications
- Store all medications away from extreme  $\bullet$ temperatures, direct light and moisture. Make sure that they are always kept away from children and pets. Do not store your medications in the bathroom
- Keep your medications in your carry-on bag when you travel, and always keep an updated medication list with phone numbers of your transplant coordinator and pharmacy with you

- Contact your transplant team if you are feeling too ill to take your medications or are unable to keep them down because of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Do not take an extra dose without contacting the transplant team for instructions
- $\bullet$ Make sure you do not run out of your medications. It is important to contact your pharmacy ahead of the time for refills, in case they need to order the medication. Always try to use the same pharmacy for all your medications so they can check for drug interactions
- Call the transplant team if you have any side effects or if you are ever uncertain about a medication or its dose
- Never cut or split pills in half to take unless  $\bullet$ directed by your transplant team. This is especially important for your anti-rejection medications. If you need alternate dosage forms call the coordinator office
- You can take your medications with or without food but be as consistent as possible

## **Avoiding infections**

In order to protect your new heart and prevent your body's immune system from rejecting it, you are taking "immunosuppressive medications." These anti-rejection medicines suppress your natural immune system (white blood cells that fight infection) so that the new heart is not seen as a foreign object by your body. However, these same important medications increase your risk for infection allowing normally harmless organisms to cause illness.

The types of infections that can occur include:

- Viral
- Bacterial
- Fungal

### Viral infections

During the pre-transplant workup you were tested for numerous infections. Over the span of your lifetime you can develop antibodies to different infections that then lay dormant in your body. However, these infections can reactivate after transplant due to your immune comprised status.

### **CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV)**

CMV is a common infection following heart transplantation. You are at greatest risk in the first three months after transplant because of the high doses of immunosuppressive medications. More than half of all Americans have had previous exposure to CMV, a benign illness, causing flu-like symptoms in the normal population. Reactivation after transplant can occur and cause serious infection.

### **Signs of CMV infection include:**

- Diarrhea
- Nausea/Vomiting
- Abdominal cramping
- Fatigue
- Fever
- Night sweats
- Achy joints

If we can catch CMV early, many times we can treat with oral medications and not have to admit you to the hospital. Late detection frequently requires admission to the hospital for intravenous medications to treat.

### **Bacterial infections**

Bacterial infections frequently occur after transplant. Bacteria are normally found throughout the body and on the skin. Normally, these bacteria do not typically cause a problem, however, they may lead to infections after transplant because of the immunosuppressive medications you are

taking. Immediately after surgery, wound infections can occur and the incision site must be monitored closely for any signs of redness, swelling, tenderness or drainage. You may or may not have a slightly elevated fever. You should notify your nurse, or, if out of the hospital, call your transplant coordinator.

Bacterial infections can be caused by staph, strep, pseudomonas or other organisms. They can occur at any place in the body including lungs, bloodstream, urinary tract or incisions (as previously mentioned). Fever is the most common sign of a bacterial infection. If an infection is suspected you will be asked to come to the hospital to give blood, urine and/or sputum samples. When a bacterial organism is identified, it is tested against a group of antibiotics to see which antibiotic is effective against the organism. You will then be started on that antibiotic. It is very important to finish all the antibiotic ordered for you even if you feel better before finished. Bacteria can become resistant to an antibiotic if all of the bacteria have not been killed. Next time you have the infection that antibiotic may not work for you.

### **Preventing infections**

Because anti-rejection medications interfere with your body's defenses, you need to make sure to protect yourself from infection by taking the following precautions:

- Wash your hands carefully and frequently. This is the single most effective way to decrease the spread of germs and to prevent infection
- Keep your hands away from your face and mouth
- Wash your hands after coughing or sneezing, and throw tissues into the trash immediately
- Practice good dental hygiene and brush your teeth a minimum of twice daily to prevent infection in your gums

- Take good care of your skin. No matter how small, carefully clean cuts and scrapes with soap and water. The medications you are taking can delay wound healing
- Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet and follow safe food preparation quidelines. (See Food and Nutrition section)
- Limit your visitors for the first weeks
- If your visitors have cold or flu symptoms ask them to return when they are well
- Avoid crowds for the first three months
- If someone in your family becomes ill with a cold or flu, have that person follow normal precautions (using separate drinking glasses, separate towels, covering their mouth when coughing, frequent hand washing, etc.) Notify us as we may prescribe medications for you
- Keep your house clean and free of excess dust
- Do not work in or visit any form of construction site. Dust can cause fungal infections which may be harmful. If visiting this type of area becomes necessary you must obtain permission from your transplant team and you MUST wear a mask
- You may mow the lawn the first year but you must wear a mask. The mask is recommended lifelong when you mow. A lawnmower blows bacteria from the grass which can cause an infection
- You may garden but you should wear garden gloves and a mask when gardening. Soil has many molds and fungi that can be sources of infection
- If you enjoy fishing, use caution with fish hooks, fish fins and fillet knives. Wear protective gloves when handling these items

• You may have pets but you should avoid handling animal waste and avoid contact with animals that roam outside. Do not clean bird cages, fish or turtle tanks or cat litter boxes. The feces of some animals contain parasites and can cause infections. Fish tanks can develop fungus and can be infectious. If you live alone and have no one to change the litter box, you may do it while wearing a mask and gloves

### **WHEN TO CALL THE DOCTOR**

You must monitor yourself and recognize the symptoms of infection and get treatment as soon as any of the following symptoms occur.

### Be aware: Your immunosuppressive medicines can mask the usual signs of infection so make sure you call promptly. Don't wait!

### Call your transplant team if:

- Your temperature is two degrees higher than your "normal"
- You are experiencing sweats or chills
- You "feel lousy" or have flu-like symptoms.
- You have a skin rash
- You have an area of pain, redness, tenderness or swelling
- You have a wound or cut that won't heal
- You have red, warm or draining sores
- You are/have been around someone who is actively ill
- You have a sore, scratchy throat or pain when swallowing

- You have sinus drainage that isn't clear
- You have a persistent or moist cough
- You have nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea
- You have white patches in your mouth or on your tongue
- You have trouble urinating pain or burning, constant urge or frequent urination.
- You have bloody, cloudy or foulsmelling urine
- You are short of breath

Keep in mind you may not experience any of these signs but you may just not feel "normal."

## **Health Maintenance**

### **IMMUNIZATIONS**

After your transplant, you will need to avoid all vaccines for up to one year except for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccines, which can be given one to three months post-transplant. Your transplant team will notify you when you can get these vaccines if you are under one year from transplant. All transplant patients should receive the HIGH DOSE flu vaccine, regardless of age.

### Pneumonia Polysaccharide (Pneumovax):

Pneumovax is given twice, five years apart. The exception would be if you received the first two Pneumovax before the age of 65, then you should receive a third vaccine after age 65 (waiting five years from the last Pneumovax).

Pneumococcal conjugate (Prevnar): You will receive this once as an adult, and will be given either eight weeks before or one year after your Pneumovax.

Tdap: Every 10 years

**Shingrix:** New shingles vaccine (not a live vaccine), two series vaccination two to six months apart.

Transplant patients should NEVER receive live vaccines such as MMR, polio, yellow fever, smallpox or chickenpox.

**Dental:** We recommend seeing a dentist a minimum of once per year for dental cleaning and check-up because the mouth is a source of infection. We will want you to wait three months after transplant before going to the dentist. Some patients require antibiotics before dental procedures based on their last echocardiogram results. Please call your transplant team at least a week before any dental cleaning or procedures to see if you will require antibiotics prior.

**Dermatology:** Skin cancer is the most common malignancy post-transplant. We require you to see a dermatologist annually for a full-body skin check. Sun protection and avoidance are the most effective ways to prevent skin cancer.

Avoid midday sun (10 a.m. to 3 p.m.) when UV rays are the strongest. Wear a hat, long sleeves and pants when outdoors. Use sunscreen SPF 30 or greater. Don't forget your face, neck and hands. Reapply as needed.

Keep your skin as clean and oil-free as possible as your medications will cause you to be more prone to acne. Use a washcloth and mild soap.

Take good care of your skin; carefully clean cuts and scrapes with soap and water. The medications you take can delay wound healing. Please let us know if you develop any signs or symptoms of infection of the wound or if the wound is not healing.

Prednisone will change the condition of your hair. Permanent hair dyes, tints and bleach may cause your hair to become brittle and break. It is important to tell your hairstylist you are taking prednisone and use a good conditioner.

Eye: Immunosuppressants can cause general vision changes and, in some cases, cataracts, diabetic eye complications and vascular changes. You will need to see an eye doctor annually to check for these conditions.

Primary Care Provider: You will need a local primary care doctor after transplant. A primary care doctor is an important part of your team to help manage general health complaints, fill non-cardiac related medications, and help manage your care outside of your heart transplant.

## **Nutrition after transplant**

### Your Guide to Eating Healthy After Your Heart Transplant

The diet guidelines in this handout are meant to help you to optimize your new heart and prevent problems.

### **WHY DO I NEED TO PRACTICE FOOD SAFETY?**

Food safety is especially important after transplant surgery because you are at higher risk for food-borne illness while you are taking immune suppression drugs. Safe food storage and preparation will help to protect you from bacteria and other harmful organisms that can be found in some food and drinks. You can find more specific guidelines on pages 2 and 3.

### **HOW AND WHAT SHOULD I EAT AFTER MY TRANSPLANT?**

Your body will require extra calories and protein during the first few weeks after your transplant. It is important to meet your nutrition needs to help with healing. Even if your appetite is not good, it is important to eat. It may help to eat small, more frequent meals or to add a nutrition supplement (like Boost, Ensure, Carnation Instant Breakfast or similar supplements) if you are not eating enough. Your dietitian will help you find a supplement you like if one is needed.

Some patients will experience high blood sugars after transplant for short-term or long-term. This

may be because of the stress of the surgery, from some of the medications you are taking, or if you are already diabetic. It is important to keep your blood sugars under good control to help decrease stress on your new heart, help with healing and recover faster. You may need an assessment of your diet for the types and amounts of carbohydrates you may be eating based on your diabetes management discharge plan.

It is important to follow a heart-healthy diet longterm. You are at high risk of developing coronary artery disease in your new heart, so making smart food choices is especially important. After your transplant, many people may try to help by giving nutrition advice. It is important to be cautious of fad diets and the use of supplements. Fad diets often make promises that are untrue and unsafe.

### **WHAT IF I NEED TO WATCH CERTAIN ELECTROLYTES IN MY DIET?**

Your medications may affect the levels of certain electrolytes in your body, especially potassium and magnesium. You may need to decrease or increase your intake of foods high in these electrolytes. Information on these foods can be found on pages 10 and 11.

### Food Safety After a Heart Transplant

### Food safety in the kitchen

- Maintain temperatures
  - Refrigerator 34 to 40°F
  - Freezer below 5°F
- Place raw meat on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator
- Cook hot foods to be a minimum internal temperature of 165°F and keep cold foods below 40°F
- Cook meats until well done
  - Beef above 160°F
  - Poultry above 165°F
  - Fish above 145°F
  - Eggs above 160°F
- DO NOT leave frozen foods out on the counter to thaw. Defrost by placing in the refrigerator or microwave. Use defrosted foods right away, don't refreeze
- Never leave perishable foods out of the refrigerator for over two hours. Put food away right after serving to help reduce the risk of bacterial growth
- Consume leftovers within two to three days and reheat to 165°F.
- Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly under running water before peeling or cutting; cut away bruised areas
- Wash tops of canned foods before opening and wash the can opener after each use
- Keep soap readily available for hand washing. Wash hands for at least 30

seconds with warm soapy water, before and after food preparation and consumption

- Wash hands frequently and use paper towels for drying hands versus a community towel
- Keep appliances free from food particles
- Use separate cutting boards for raw and cooked foods
- Keep counter and kitchen surfaces clean
- Replace dish cloths daily. DO NOT use sponges
- Keep the refrigerator clean from spills
- Avoid raw meats, ready-to-eat foods  $\bullet$ such as hot dogs, luncheon meats, cold cuts, soft cheeses, deli-style meats
- Drink only pasteurized milk and juice products (i.e. not all frozen juice concentrates are pasteurized)

### Seafood:

- Fully cooked preferred.
- Tempura (cooked) sushi is OK
- Caution against raw sushi. If consumed, you should assure with food preparers that fish is flash frozen

We recommend that you do not go out to eat for at least three months post transplant. When you can resume going out to eat, make sure to:

- Go early to avoid crowds and avoid peak meal times
- DO NOT eat at buffets or community potluck events
- Select restaurants with a reputation for cleanliness
- Request single-serve condiment packages; avoid self-serve bulk condiment containers

### Food Safety When Shopping

- Shop backwards! Start with nonperishable foods first; shop for perishable foods last. This will help to reduce the time the food is out of refrigeration
- Check all "sell by," "use by," and packaging dates on foods
- DO NOT purchase damaged, swollen, rusted, or deeply dented cans. Check boxed/packaged foods for proper seals.
- Avoid tasting free samples at the grocery store
- Put away groceries promptly when you get home

### **Heart Healthy Eating**

A heart healthy diet is meant to help lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure. It may help to decrease the risk of heart disease. It includes eating a variety of foods that are low in fat, especially saturated fat and trans fats. The diet is also low in cholesterol and low in sodium. Adding fiber and Omega-3 fatty acids to your diet are recommended.

### What do these terms mean?

Saturated Fats: These fats are usually solid at room temperature. They are the "bad" fats that raise cholesterol. Some sources are: high-fat dairy products, high-fat meat products, butter, lard, palm and tropical oils.

- A low saturated fat item will have only 1 gram/serving
- A saturated fat-free item will have less than 0.5 gram/serving
- Aim for <5-6% of total calories from saturated fat

Trans Fats: A process called hydrogenation turns liquid (unsaturated) fats (or oils) into solid fats. This type of fat, like saturated fat, can raise your cholesterol levels. You should avoid this type of fat. Some sources of trans fat include: some margarines, vegetable shortenings, peanut butter, crackers, cookies, etc. Recommended <1% of total calories from trans fat.

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** This is a type of polyunsaturated fat that may help to prevent blood clots and help your blood vessels dilate (or get bigger). This can make your blood flow more smoothly. They are the "good" types of fat. Adding this type of fat to your diet is recommended.

- Sources include: Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, tuna, halibut, lake trout, sardines, etc.), canola oil, flaxseed and nuts (1 1/2 oz/day)
- Consumption of fish two to three times a week is recommended

**Sodium:** Sodium is in most foods naturally. Processed foods are usually high in sodium. Many food items have low-sodium varieties. Sodium can cause you to retain fluid and/or increase your blood pressure. No more than 2300 mg sodium (new quidelines) a day is recommended.

- Try to use other herbs/seasonings instead of salt (use salt substitutes only with a doctor's permission)
- A low sodium item will have 140 mg of sodium or less/serving
- A very low sodium item will have 35 mg of sodium or less/serving

**Fiber:** Fiber occurs naturally in some foods. There are two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Studies have shown that fiber can help to lower cholesterol levels. The recommended amount of fiber per day is 25 to 35 grams. Slowly add fiber into your diet if you do not eat it regularly. Adding a lot of fiber at once can cause stomach cramping and/or gas.

Soluble Fiber: Found in oats, barley, legumes, vegetables and fruits.

**Insoluble Fiber:** Found in skins of fruits and vegetables, wheat and grains.

- An excellent source of fiber will have 5 grams or more per serving
- A good source of fiber has 3 grams or more per serving

### How much fat can I have in a day?

The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends no more than 30% of your total calories to come from fat. The recommendation is different for each person. It is based on how many calories you need everyday. You can visit the website http://www.choosemyplate.gov to find a meal plan for you.

![](_page_28_Picture_0.jpeg)

### How do I read the food label?

Nutrition labels are found on almost all packaged and processed food items. Some fresh fruits and vegetables, raw fish, meat and poultry also have a food label. Compare labels of similar products to find the best choice for your needs. Here is an example of a food label.

The Nutrition Facts label information is based on ONE serving but many packages contain more.

Look at serving size to see how many servings you're actually consuming.

An excellent source of fiber will have 5 grams or more per serving. A good source of fiber will have 3 grams or more per serving. My daily fiber goal: 25 to 35 grams total/day.

### Tips in preparing heart-healthy foods

- Use nonstick cookware or a fat-free nonstick  $\bullet$ spray (like Pam, etc.)
- Bake, boil, broil, grill, microwave, poach or  $\bullet$ roast instead of frying foods
- Trim any fat and skin from meat before  $\bullet$ cooking it
- Place meat on a rack so the fat can drain;  $\bullet$ discard meat drippings
- Use herbs and spices to add flavor to the  $\bullet$ food instead of butter and/or salt
- Try using marinades to flavor and tenderize  $\bullet$ meats. Anything that contains acid will work as a marinade (like seasoned vinegars, lemon or lime juices, fruit or fruit juices, etc.)
- Buy lean cuts of meat (90% lean or leaner)  $\bullet$
- Steam vegetables in water or low-sodium broth instead of fat
- Have fruit for dessert

## **Blood sugar control following transplant**

### Hyperglycemia or high blood sugars post-transplant can occur for several reasons including:

- Prior diagnosis of diabetes
- Prior diagnosis of pre-diabetes, glucose intolerance or hyperglycemia (high blood sugars)
- Stress induced
- Steroid induced

Diabetes or hyperglycemia is an illness that affects how your body's cells utilize glucose for energy.

### There are many factors that put a person at risk for diabetes including:

- A family history of diabetes
- Obesity
- Being African American or Latino
- Being over 40
- Inactive lifestyle
- Anti-rejection drugs
- Hepatitis C

If you had diabetes prior to your transplant, the anti-rejection medications can make your blood sugars more difficult to control.

### Diabetes and other reasons for hyperglycemia following transplant are important to treat because it:

- May increase the risk that the transplanted organ will fail
- May increase the risk of premature death, especially from heart disease and stroke
- May increase the risk of other complications seen in Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes such as blindness

(retinopathy), nerve damage (neuropathy), or kidney failure (nephropathy)

If you develop post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) your treatment will be individualized based on your blood sugar control needs and will include treatment approaches to protect against possible longterm complications of Type 2 diabetes. These approaches may include:

- Maintaining a healthy lifestyle including diet and exercise
- Use of diabetes oral medications and/or insulin based on blood sugar treatment needs
- Regular blood sugar monitoring
  - Recommend blood glucose levels 100 to 180

### Education needs during your hospital stay

If you have diabetes or high blood sugars after your transplant, diabetes educators and registered dietitian/nutrition specialists will work with you to provide self-management education for your individual treatment plan. Your education needs will vary based on your medication discharge plan for controlling your blood sugars. Education may include:

- Learning to monitor your own blood sugars
- Learning about use of oral diabetes medications or insulin
- Recommendations for food choices for meals and snacks
- Recognizing symptoms and how to treat high blood sugars or low blood sugars

 $continued$ 

## **Blood sugar control following transplant continued**

• Individualized blood glucose targets

Nebraska ledicine

- Follow-up plans for controlling your blood  $\bullet$ sugars
- Who to contact for questions concerning your blood sugars after discharge

### Living with diabetes or hyperglycemia following your transplant

- Ask questions during your hospital stay and during your follow-up visits
- Obtain support from family members, friends and other who you may know have diabetes as well as your transplant team, primary care physician, nutrition specialist and diabetes educator.

The more you learn about your diabetes or hyperglycemia the more it will be of help to keep your blood sugars under control. Control of your blood sugar is one of the most important factors in preventing the development of post-transplantation heart disease. We realize having diabetes and/ or high blood sugars after your transplant does add more challenges to your treatment plan. It may require you to pay more attention to what you are eating, include diabetes medications and to check your blood sugars on a regular basis. Regular follow-up with your health care team for review of your blood sugars will be needed to help determine if you will continue to need the diabetes medications you were prescribed at discharge. Diabetes medications should not be stopped or adjusted without talking to your doctor or transplant coordinator.

### Eating to help control your blood sugars

It is important to be consistent with your intake of carbohydrates to help control your blood sugars. The best way to know how much carbohydrate is in the food you eat is to look at the food label on the package.

\*The amount of carbohydrates you can eat is based on the amounts or portion of food you eat. There are numerous information sources for determining carbohydrate amounts, including:

- Nutrition fact labels (see page N10)
- Web-based programs
- Books and pamphlets

A carbohydrate choice is the amount of food which provides around 15 grams of carbohydrates. The amount of carbohydrates recommended for you can be discussed with your dietitian or diabetes educator.

Below is a conversion guide to help you to convert grams of carbohydrates to number of choices:

| Grams of<br>Carbohydrates | # of<br><b>Carbohydrate Choices</b> |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 15                        |                                     |

## **Biopsies, lab work and testing**

Performing a heart biopsy is the best way of monitoring rejection and planning anti-rejection therapy in patients with heart transplants. It also provides early detection of rejection before clinical symptoms occur. Heart biopsy is the single most effective way to evaluate for heart transplant rejection. A biopsy is obtained by retrieving and examining tissue from your heart.

### You will have follow up appointments, labs and testing on the following schedule:

- Weekly for the first four weeks
- Every two weeks during the second month
- At 12 weeks
- Monthly up to six months
- Every three months after this up to second year

Your transplant coordinator will specify what labs, testing and appointments you will have on your discharge transplant schedule.

\*\*This appointment schedule may change based on how you are doing after transplant and any abnormal symptoms or labs per your physicians guidance.

The biopsy schedule could change based on each patient's rejection history.

Repeat biopsies following episodes of rejection are to be performed within one week depending on the severity of rejection and clinical condition.

Usually your first one or two biopsies will be done while you are recovering from your surgery and still in the hospital.

After you have been discharged from the hospital, you will come in as an outpatient.

You will need to not eat or drink anything four hours prior to arriving at the hospital for your biopsy. You will need to take all your morning medications unless told otherwise. Please refer to your biopsy letter for specific instructions or contact the transplant team if you are unsure. If you are taking a blood thinner, you will need to hold this medication and will need special instructions. Please call your coordinator.

![](_page_38_Picture_17.jpeg)

Your biopsies will be performed by going through the right internal jugular vein on the right side of your neck. In most instances, local

anesthetic is given instead of general anesthesia. Your physician will clip 3-5 pieces of tissue from your right ventricle which will then be examined by a pathologist to evaluate for rejection.

The pathologist will classify (grade) results according to a scale that has been developed by The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation.

| <b>Class</b>   | Interpretation        | <b>Treatment</b>        |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Ω              | No Rejection          | No Treatment            |
| 1 <sub>R</sub> | <b>Mild Rejection</b> | Usually No<br>Treatment |
| 2R             | Moderate<br>Rejection | <b>Treatment Given</b>  |
| 3R             | Severe Rejection      | Usually in Hospital     |

![](_page_39_Picture_0.jpeg)

## **Testing continued**

Your transplant coordinator will notify you with the results of your biopsy within one to three days. Since biopsy results are released immediately to you, you may see them before your nurse or provider has had a chance to review them.

Rest assured that your team is watching for the results and will call you with the results and what they mean. Treatment may or may not be needed depending upon the results.

### HeartCare: Allomap/Allosure Testing

Allomap/Allosure testing measures the expression levels of specific genes found in your blood related to rejection. Used together with clinical assessment, Allomap/Allosure can help inform your doctor whether you could potentially be rejecting your heart. It is a simple, noninvasive method of blood sample collection. Allomap/Allosure is reported as a score. If it is positive, you will need to come have a biopsy within 7 to 10 days to rule out rejection. If you have two positive allomap/allosures with two negative biopsies, your coordinator will review with your physician as to whether or not allomap/allosure is an accurate test for you or should not be used going forward. In the event this happens, and we no longer check allomap/allosure levels, we will rely on lab tests, echocardiograms, and testing deemed relevant by your physician to evaluate for rejection.

Allomap/Allosure testing may be used at two months post-transplant. Your doctor will decide when we will start checking Allomap/Allosure levels. Allomap/Allosure level has to be drawn at Nebraska Medical Center and cannot be drawn elsewhere.

Allomap has not been studied in patients younger than 15 years.

Echocardiogram: an ultrasound of your heart that will be performed after each biopsy. You will get an echocardiogram at your following appointments, 4 month, 5 month, 6 month, 9 month, 1 year, 15 month, 18 month, 21 month, 2 year, 2.5 year and annually after that.

### Usual laboratory work after heart transplantation

Your lab work will be obtained prior to biopsies and more frequently as needed based on how you are feeling/doing.

### Routine lab that is collected is:

- $\left( \begin{array}{c} 1 \end{array} \right)$ CBC: measures number of white blood cells and red blood cells in the blood.
- 2) Complete Metabolic Panel: evaluates liver function, kidney function and potassium.

### 3) Lipid Panel:

- Cholesterol: Excess amounts tend to deposit in the walls of major blood vessels and impede the flow of blood. Values greater than 200 place you at risk to develop heart disease
- Triglycerides: Blood fats that represent the body's major reserve of chemical energy
- HDL cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein): This is "good" cholesterol. HDL should be greater than 35 in women and greater than 45 in men to protect you from developing heart disease

## **Testing continued**

- LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein): This is the "bad" cholesterol. Elevation of LDL is associated with an increased risk for heart disease. LDL should be less than 70 for those that have received a heart transplant
- 4) Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Ultrasensitive: TSH is a measure of thyroid function. Low or high levels may indicate thyroid disease.
- 5) Magnesium: Is an electrolyte necessary for normal functioning of muscles and for blood clotting.
- 6) CMV: To check for presence of the CMV virus.
- 7) Drug levels are taken for the following medications: tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus and everolimus.

On a day when your medication level is to be measured, do not take your morning dose until AFTER your blood has been drawn. For timing of specific medications and lab draws see Medication section. After your lab draw, take your prescribed dose. Once the lab has processed the blood level, your doctor will evaluate the results and decide if dosage changes are needed.

\*Remember to bring immunosuppression medication with you to take after blood is drawn. Bring a list of your current medications and your log of blood pressure, weight and blood sugars with you to each appointment.

- Cell Mediated Immunity (Immuknow, CMI): 8) blood level that gives indication of how strong or suppressed your immune system is. We may make medication adjustments based on this level. This level is time sensitive and must be drawn by the time indicated by coordinator. \*\* This has to be drawn at Nebraska Medical Center\*\*
- 9) Donor Specific Antibody (DSA): These are antibodies that the recipient can develop to the donor organ. These are checked periodically post transplant to evaluate for antibody mediated rejection. \*\* These have to be drawn at Nebraska Medical Center\*\*

You will not be called with normal lab results. You will only be called if your labs are outside the normal limits and we need to make medication changes. If you don't receive a call about your lab results, continue your same medication doses and get labs at next instructed interval.

Any questions or problems, don't hesitate to call the heart transplant coordinator.

## **Starting your exercise program**

### Exercise while in the hospital

The cardiac rehab staff will begin walking with you within a couple days after your transplant. You must be off the ventilator (breathing machine) and considered stable by your doctors before the nurses will begin your exercise. When you leave your hospital room you will wear a surgical mask. You will wear a heart monitor and will have your blood pressure checked before and after exercise.

One of the ways we determine how you are handling the exercise is your breathing. You should be able to walk and talk at the same time. If you are too short of breath to do this, we will have you slow down and rest. The goal will be to walk 4 to 6 times a day in the hospital hall after you are out of the ICU. The Cardiac Rehab nurse will let you know your goals for each day.

### While in the hospital, exercise will help you:

- Develop more energy
- Keep your muscles and bones strong and healthy
- Deal with the stress and anxiety associated with this hospitalization

I now walk one mile and bike two miles every day. Cardiac Rehab was a great experience.

- Nebraska Medicine patient

### You will receive a handout called "PHASE I CARDIAC REHAB DISCHARGE **INSTRUCTIONS FROM HEART SURGERY"** that includes other instructions about activity and

exercise restrictions due to the fact that you have a chest incision. Please review these instructions carefully also.

A referral to outpatient Phase II Cardiac Rehab will be made for you once you are discharged from the hospital. The purpose of outpatient rehab will be to gradually increase your strength and endurance and to help prevent the progression of heart disease. This will be achieved through a combination of monitored exercise sessions and education. Outpatient Cardiac Rehab will be three times a week for four to eight weeks. While exercise is important, reducing your heart disease risk factors is equally important. Your heart disease risk factors have been identified on the discharge sheet given to you by the Cardiac Rehab nurse.

## **Exercise** continued

Nebraska<br>Medicine

### Home exercise guidelines after heart transplantation

Continuing to exercise after discharge from the hospital plays an important role in recovery after heart transplantation. It is important to get regular exercise to keep your transplanted heart healthy.

Progression at home can be slow prior to entering a Cardiac Rehab program. You can begin to lengthen walking time before adding speed or incline.

Do NOT do any weight lifting.

No lifting, pushing or pulling anything heavier than 10 pounds for six weeks and then 25 pounds for another six weeks.

### There are many benefits of exercise, including but not limited to:

- Less feelings of shortness of breath and fatigue
- Lower resting and exercise blood pressure
- Increased lean body mass and less weight gain
- Decreased blood cholesterol
- Improved quality of life

### Exercise prescription goals

### **FREQUENCY:**

Three to six days each week.

### **DURATION:**

Total exercise time 30 to 60 minutes per day.

### **DENERVATION:**

When you receive a heart transplant, the main nerves from your brain to your heart are cut which is called "denervation". Your brain is no longer responsible for telling your heart to speed up and slow down and your body must rely on other, much slower, ways to increase and decrease your heart rate.

### **WARM UP AND COOL DOWN:**

### 5 to 10 minutes at a slow pace.

This is very important because of the denervation of your heart. Your body needs this time to allow the heart rate to increase before exercise and to decrease after exercise. Do not skip either of these if you are short on time. You are better to cut out some of your exercise time, not the warm up or cool down.

### **GOAL:**

Exercise 30 to 60 minutes three to six days a week for the rest of your life. This is the equivalent of a minimum of 150 minutes per week.

- Warm-up by walking slowly
- Begin aerobic exercise
- Cool-down by slowing pace
- Stretch

Always increase the amount of time before increasing the difficulty of the exercise. Slowly increase your exercise by adding one minute every other day as long as you are without "warning symptoms."

## **Exercise continued**

### Warning symptoms

Stop and rest if the any of the following occur:

- Fast heart rate (palpitations)
- Chest discomfort or pain (angina)
- Irregular heart rate
- Slow heart rate
- Faintness, dizziness, light headed
- Unusual leg pain or cramping
- Nausea
- Cold sweat
- Unusual shortness of breath
- Fluttering in the chest
- Weakness

Call your physician if you do not feel relief at rest.

### Follow these guidelines

- Don't push yourself too hard. Listen to your body. If you're in pain or really worn out after exercise, you've done too much. Next time, don't drive yourself so hard
- Set realistic exercise goals. Start slow and work up gradually. Just getting yourself to walk a little extra whenever you can helps. Find an activity you really enjoy and stick with it

## When to call: danger signs and symptoms

### DANGER SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

This chapter is meant to remind you there may be times when you will experience symptoms that should be reported right away. They may be symptoms of developing infection or they may be signs of rejection. In any case, your transplant team should be notified immediately.

### Call your transplant team if:

- Your temperature is 2 degrees higher than your "normal" temperature
- You have shortness of breath
- You have difficulty breathing while lying on your back
- You have a fast or irregular heart beat *(feeling of palpitations)*
- You have a fast breathing rate
- You have increased weight or swelling
- You feel tired and are not able to exercise as much
- You have flu-like symptoms: chills, aches, headache, dizziness, nausea or vomiting
- You have an unexplainable poor appetite
- You have a skin rash
- You have an area of pain, redness, tenderness or swelling
- You have a wound or cut that won't heal
- You have red, warm or draining sores
- You have a sore, scratchy throat or pain when swallowing
- You have sinus drainage that isn't clear
- You have a persistent or moist cough
- You have nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea

- You have white patches in your mouth or on your tongue
- You have trouble urinating  $-$  pain or burning, constant urge or frequent urination
- You have bloody, cloudy or foul-smelling urine
- Somebody you come in contact with was diagnosed with a serious communicable illness
- You have thoughts of ending your life or giving up, which is an indication of severe depression
- You are unable to master the energy to get out of bed, eat or bathe

Remember also to always call your transplant team if another doctor wants you to start on a new medicine.

It is always best to call the office and get advice from the transplant coordinator if you have any change in your condition.

## Living with a new heart

### Your daily routine

Take your vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate) every morning and every evening as directed by your transplant team. Record them in your logbook and bring to biopsy and clinic visits.

Weigh daily, first thing in the morning after going to the bathroom and before eating. Use the same scale and wear the same amount of clothing. Record in your logbook.

Record blood sugars as directed.

Take your medicines as directed by your transplant team. NEVER skip a dose of your immunosuppressive medication. Call your transplant coordinator if you miss a dose.

Bathe or shower daily using a mild soap.

If you have dry skin, apply a mild skin lotion after bathing.

Avoid lotion, creams, powder or ointments on the incision unless ordered by the surgery team. Avoid these products until the incision is completely healed and all the scabs have fallen off.

Frequently wash your hands with soap and warm water, especially before preparing food, after using the bathroom or after touching soiled linens or clothes. Lather well; rubbing your hands together and cleaning all surfaces including under the nail bed.

Stay active (See Exercise chapter).

### Promoting emotional wellness after transplant

• Set small, easily achievable goals each day and keep track of them on a chart

![](_page_45_Figure_15.jpeg)

- Engage in spiritually uplifting behaviors such as reading motivational quotes, inspirational books, time outdoors or utilizing church support
- If feeling stressed or down, remind yourself that this is a recovery period of transition and you will not always feel this way
- It's normal to have an adjustment period after transplant. If your feelings of stress or depressed mood start to affect your daily activities, it is recommended you discuss this at your follow-up appointments or we can make referrals for counseling

![](_page_46_Picture_0.jpeg)

Talk to your emotional support network daily about your emotions. Use "I feel..." statements to convey your stress, worry, fear, frustration, anger, etc., help reduce blame and keep open communication with your care partner or support system. Remember it's normal these role changes and recovery period can temporarily cause additional stress in your relationships

### Sexual activity

You may resume sexual activity after your transplant surgery. How quickly you return to your usual patterns will depend mostly on your recovery progress. Sexual activity usually can be resumed four to six weeks post transplant. However, it is important to maintain strict sternal precautions: no pulling, lifting or pushing with the arms or chest. Lifting restrictions are 10 pounds for six weeks and 25 pounds for an additional six weeks. If the sternum is not healing, the surgeon will lengthen the time for restrictions.

Your sexual functioning may be affected by your transplantation and/or certain medications. Some people avoid sexual activity because they are afraid of rejection or of infection. If you have any of these fears, you may want to check with your transplant team. If you are sexually active and do not have a steady sexual partner, you must use condoms to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS, syphilis, herpes, hepatitis or gonorrhea. You must use contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy also. Don't be afraid to ask your doctor, nurse or heart transplant coordinator questions about this while you are hospitalized or during your clinic visits.

Sexual concerns after heart transplantation are commonly experienced yet seldomly voiced. Erectile dysfunction is common in male patients who have cardiovascular disease and in patients who are on high blood pressure medication. The sensitivity of the topic may prevent open discussion with your health care providers and can delay referrals, changes in medications and treatment. ED should be reported to your primary care doctor and your transplant cardiologist as soon as possible so that referrals or treatment can be done as soon as possible.

### Returning to work or school

The goal of heart transplantation is to improve your quality of life and get you back to doing things you were previously able to do, one of those things being work or school. We will help determine your readiness to return as it depends on many factors including the type of work you perform and how you are recovering. Some people are able to return to work as early as three months after transplant. While some people are eager to return to work as soon as they can, we understand for others this may be a source of anxiety. For some there may be fears surrounding the thoughts of losing disability or trying to find a new line of work that fits with their new posttransplant life. It is important to know that one year after transplant, you may no longer qualify for disability from a cardiac standpoint. Because of this, we have many resources including social workers, financial counselors and vocational rehab, which can help you through this process.

### **Driving**

You will not be allowed to drive after your transplant until you are released by your transplant team. Ask your transplant surgeon about driving when you have your first follow-up visit. You can start driving typically four weeks after your transplant and when off narcotics. However, the ability to drive can be lengthened depending on your overall physical condition.

### Alcoholic beverages

Drinking beer, wine and liquor may damage your liver. Medications such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole are broken down by the liver and, if combined with alcohol, could harm your liver. Call your transplant team for advice. Drinking alcohol is allowed in moderation.

### Smoking

The Surgeon General of the United States has determined that both active and passive smoking can be harmful to your health. Smoking is a risk factor for many diseases. It will increase your risk for developing coronary artery vasculopathy, damaging your new heart and add to your already increased risk for osteoporosis, development of cancers and lung disease. DO NOT SMOKE. Ask your friends/spouse not to smoke when you are around. If you need further assistance to quit smoking call the transplant team. There are many options available to help you stop smoking. We do not want you to use cigarettes, vape or Juul Pods.

Several chemicals in these liquids have been proven to cause cancer.

### Pregnancy

Pregnancy after heart transplantation is considered a high-risk condition. You need to carefully consider this risk to your life and the baby's life. You should discuss children and birth control options with your transplant team. Men with heart transplants have been able to father children. Because of the medications that you take, it is important to discuss the possible risks to the baby with your transplant team.

Conceiving a child while on transplant medications may cause serious birth defects so it is important that two forms of birth control be used following transplant. For females that are sexually active and not already on birth control, you should see your OB-GYN immediately to discuss birth control options.

The decision of if and when to become pregnant after transplant should be discussed thoroughly with your transplant cardiologist, so that if you decide to become pregnant, medication adjustments can be made and you can be monitored closely to reduce the risk of complications.

### Vacation and travel

Travel can lead you to many new and exciting places as well as to new environments filled with potential challenges for the immunocompromised individual. We recommend that you do not travel

For more information, call 800.922.0000 or go to NebraskaMed.com/Transplant

for the first year post transplant since you are at the highest risk for rejection and infection.

Be alert and behave wisely. When taking public transportation, remember there will be many people traveling with you, sometimes in close proximity such as buses, trains and planes. Air is recirculated in these environments which means that you may be breathing air containing viruses and bacteria from other passengers. For the first year after transplantation when your immunosuppression is at its highest, it is recommended that you avoid mass transportation as much as possible. If you decide to travel, it is advisable to wear a facemask to filter the air as much as possible. You may wish to continue this practice on long journeys on planes or trains. Once you are one year post transplant and you would like to travel, you need to make sure to do these important steps prior to leaving.

- 1. Notify your transplant team where you are going.
- 2. Know where the closest transplant center is to you.
- 3. Make sure to pack all medications in your carry on luggage.
- 4. Make sure to always take two extra weeks of medication with you in case you get stuck somewhere longer than planned.

Travel outside the United States can present health risks to individuals whether or not they are immunocompromised. Therefore, it is wise for you to take extra precautions. It is best to contact your transplant coordinator or physician to discuss the area you plan to visit. Your transplant team can advise you on contacts at a transplant center in the area whenever possible. They can

also advise you on how to obtain information on current health risks for the area in which you are planning to travel. If you are traveling outside of the country, you may be directed to visit the Travel Clinic to see if any immunizations or medications may be needed prior to traveling.

### **Medications**

Your transplant team recommends you carry identification with you at all times that you are a transplant patient. In addition, you should always carry an updated medication list with you. You may ask your transplant coordinator about how to obtain a medical alert bracelet or you may go online at www.ldentifyYourself.com.

Please contact your transplant doctor or coordinator prior to starting any new medications that a primary care doctor or a referring doctor might order. There might be unkown side effects with your immune suppression medications that can be avoided.

### **Blood Donation after Transplant**

Although being a transplant recipient does not restrict you from donating blood some of your medications may restrict you from donating. If you are considering donating blood or plasma please call your transplant coordinator to discuss.

### Understanding your emotions after transplant

Most people experience some symptoms of depression or anxiety which may include:

- Feeling sad, angry, anxious or easily overwhelmed
- Fear of death
- Persistent worry
- Guilty feelings
- Crying frequently or easily
- Being unable to focus or concentrate
- Not sleeping well, sleeping too much or being unable to fall asleep
- Changes in mood  $\bullet$
- Changes in appetite
- Losing interest in health activities and relationships you used to enjoy

If these symptoms are bothersome, distracting or interfere with your relationships and ability to manage daily tasks, talk to your coordinator, physician or mental health provider for assistance.

### Guidelines to writing your donor family letter

### Anonymity

Donor families are offered the opportunity to save a life through organ donation, while their identity remains anonymous. Each family's loss is personal. How family members cope with their loss may determine their receptiveness to correspond with recipient families. Our intention is to provide support to families experiencing the grieving process and to provide the opportunity for recipients to express their gratitude to the donor families. We are encouraged by the potential emotionally healing benefits of correspondence, but we are careful to protect the confidentiality of those who do not wish to participate. Therefore, we initially limit correspondence to an anonymous format.

### Letter content

The decision to write your donor family is a very personal one. Sometimes, transplant recipients choose to write to donor families to express their gratitude. If you find that it is too difficult to write a letter, a simple card can also be uplifting to the family. We have made suggestions for the content that might be included in your correspondence. These suggestions are only meant to be a guideline and are not meant to dictate your decision to contact the donor family. However, if you write, to keep the correspondence confidential, we do ask that you exclude the following: last name, address, city, state, phone number, email address and any reference to Nebraska Medicine. Please include any information that might help the donor family "picture" you.

This letter will more than likely be read and shared with many donor family members. Care should be considered with the amount of negative information included. Even though the outcomes of some transplants are not as successful as others, this does not diminish the gift. We are still indebted

to these gracious donor families whose intentions were to save a life.

### **Examples include:**

- Address the letter "Dear Donor Family"
- Recognize the donor family's gift and include  $\bullet$ thanks for this gift
- If you wish, express your condolences for their loss
- Use your first name or nickname only; do not include your last name
- If you choose to omit your first name, simply sign: a grateful recipient, heart recipient, friend, etc.
- Your age and gender
- Your family situation such as marital status, children or grandchildren
- Your hobbies or interests
- Your job or occupation (Do not mention your employer's name or recognizable status or position.)
- Explain what has happened in your life since  $\bullet$ your transplant (Did you return to school, accept a new job, have children, travel?)
- Your current physical condition
- If you would be open to future correspondence from the donor family
- Since the religion of the donor family is unknown, please consider this if you include religious comments
- Other family members may include their own letters to the donor family
- Be sensitive to correspondence around holidays, anniversary of donor's death, etc.  $L6$

### Mailing your letter

Allow extra mailing time. Your letter is first reviewed by a Donate Life Services coordinator at Nebraska Medicine to ensure confidentiality guidelines have been observed. Next, it is mailed to the organ procurement organization (OPO) that worked with your donor's family. The OPO will then forward the letter to the donor family.

Although most families are happy to receive a letter from the recipient, every donor family is given the option of not reading the recipient's letter. Some donor families move and cannot be contacted. If your letter is unable to be forwarded, you will be notified.

### Whom do I send my letter to?

- Place your card or letter in an unsealed envelope. Please do not place a stamp, write your return address or your full name on this envelope
- Place a separate piece of paper with your full name and the date of your transplant in this unsealed envelope
- Place the unsealed envelope into another envelope addressed to:

**Donate Life Services** Nebraska Medicine 3860 Leavenworth Omaha, NE 68105-8136

### Will I hear from the donor's family?

You may or may not hear from the donor's family. Some donor families have said that writing about their loved one and their decision to donate helps them in their grieving process. Even though they are comfortable with their decision to donate, other families prefer privacy and choose not to write the recipients. Many donor families will wait until they have heard from a recipient before writing to that person.

The correspondence should be family-driven. Correspondence may be a one-direction, onetime letter of thanks, or it could evolve into a series of reciprocal letters between donor family and recipient. Each relationship will be unique. It is important to respect the comfort level of the donor family in regard to timing and frequency of sending letters.

### New Hearts Support Group

Even though it is called New Hearts, this nonprofit volunteer organization serves all organ and tissue transplant patients and donor families. New Hearts primary function as a transplant support group is to provide support services for patients who are both in the pre- and posttransplant process. New Hearts support services include:

Providing information about the transplant process and resources to family members

- Communicating with families throughout the various phases of the transplant process through visits, cards, phone calls, regular support group meetings and activities, social media, mailings and emails
- Hosting monthly transplant support and  $\bullet$ educational meeting providing a forum for recipients, caregivers, and those waiting for a transplant to share their concerns about the transplant process
- Providing small financial grants to transplant families to assist with emergency medical or living expenses.

For more information, please contact NebraskaNewHearts@gmail.com

When: Meetings and activities are usually conducted on a monthly basis.

Who: Members include transplant recipients, their families, transplant candidates, donor families, medical personnel, Social Work and clergy. For more information visit: https://newheartsnebraska.com
